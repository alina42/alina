title: "Presented at Botany 2020 - Virtual!"
---
This week I presented at the [Botany-2020 virtual meeting](https://2020.botanyconference.org/), Annual Meeting of the Botanical Society of America. <!--more--> It was quite a new experience, as I'm sure it was for everyone - video recording, answering questions in chats, etc. I really enjoyed the talks, and I really liked how well all the sections, workshops, etc. were organized. I can only imagine the amount of work which had been done to make it happen in this difficult and stressful time.

I presented one of my research projects on novel plant-insect interactions. In this project, we explored variation in plant responses to grasshopper herbivory among the cultivars of the introduced Miscanthus sinensis. 

Below is a video recording of my talk, and here are my <a href="{{ 'assets/content/publications/2020_Botany_talk.pdf' | relative_url }}">slides</a>.
