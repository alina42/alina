title: "Reviewer Board Member for Agriculture!"
---

I was invited to serve on [Reviewer Board Member](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture/submission_reviewers) for Agriculture. I really enjoy serving as a reviewer and find it very rewarding. <!--more--> As an author, I got to appreciate the time the editors and reviewers dedicate and effort they make during the peer-review process, as well as the challenges along the way. Being an reviewer means for me not only "returning" the time and efforts to the other reviewers, but it is also a non-stop learning process through which I improve my research and share what I learn with other researchers.
