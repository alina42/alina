title: "Our paper on molecular gut content analysis of the invasive spotted lanternfly published in Insects!"
---

So happy to see our [paper](https://doi.org/10.3390/insects11040215) on molecular gut content analysis of the invasive spotted lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula, published today in Insects special issue ["Molecular Gut Content Analysis: Deciphering Trophic Interactions of Insects”](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/insects/special_issues/gut_trophic_interact)! <!--more--> 
This paper summarizes the results of my work on molecular confirmation of diet of the spotted lanternfly. In this study we showed, for the first time, that host plant DNA can be identified within the gut contents of the spotted lanternfly and demonstrated the use of this approach for deciphering the host plant range of the lanternfly. I'm very happy to get it done and be able to share. I'm also very thankful to Darsy, Jessica, and Nurani - my mentees and great helpers - who helped me with routine DNA extraction, sequence editing, and depositing sequences to NCBI GenBank.
