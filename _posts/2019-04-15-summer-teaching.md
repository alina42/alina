title: "Teaching summer course in Evolutionary Biology"
---
I am super excited to teach the graduate course in [Evolutionary Biology](https://oes.umd.edu/graduates-post-baccalaureates-professionals/professional-graduate-programs/master-chemical-life-sciences-mclfs/advising-plan-study-mclfs#CLFS609J) this summer as an instructor of record. This is a fully online course offered through the [Master of Chemical and Life Sciences program](https://oes.umd.edu/graduates-post-baccalaureates-professionals/professional-graduate-programs/master-chemical-life-sciences-mclfs?utm_medium=display&utm_source=linkedin&utm_campaign=oes_mclfs&utm_content=mclfs_display&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=oes_mclfs&utm_content=mclfs_search&gclid=Cj0KCQjw19DlBRCSARIsAOnfRehbFayBrGjDxdjTOXcbbEoUtB_YH1qfzXTbt15jorhoZ_3kD8vGa_waAq7AEALw_wcB) <!--more--> (a content-based, professional master’s degree for middle and high school teachers, [ranked #6](https://www.guidetoonlineschools.com/degrees/masters-biology) in the nation as best online master’s in biology programs). This is going to be a very interesting experience for me: I taught Evolutionary Biology as part of other courses before, but I have never taught it as a separate course. Also, this is my first teaching online, and I am sure I will learn a lot!

The course has been offered for several years, so it has all the course materials set up. It includes various interactive assignments and discussions, as well as the final project which is a real lesson the teachers will demonstrate and will 'take' with them to their class. I really like this final part and that the teachers can create something new based on what they learned, and they can apply it right away in their daily work. I am very much looking forward to teaching this summer course and meeting my new students!
