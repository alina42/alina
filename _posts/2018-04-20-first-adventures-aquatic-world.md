title: "My first adventures in the aquatic world"
---

Being almost exclusively ‘terrestrial’ person in my research it has been quite an interesting
experience for me to “get wet” with both Dr. Lamp’s lab and his Aquatic Entomology class. <!--more-->
Although I am a TA in this class I fully participate in all the student activities. It’s fun, but
also I can’t stop being surprised of how different things are under water. Well, here are my first
impression:

The first surprise for me was the fact that apparently there is no such thing as “traditional”
plant-insect interactions in aquatic communities. Everyone (all insects) eats almost everything (all
leaves which fall in a stream), and all “tastes” the same as long as it provides enough nutrients. 

I also didn’t know that it is not a leaf itself that attracts aquatic insects, but a biofilm - a
bunch of different microorganisms which stick to each other and to a surface of a leaf. I learned
that “the leaf with such biofilm for aquatic insects is like a toast with peanut butter for us: a
toast itself is edible of course, but with peanut butter it is a completely different food”
(borrowed from Becca W.)

Below are some pictures from my first collections and insect identifications.
