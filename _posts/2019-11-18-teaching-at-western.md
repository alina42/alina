title: "Winter quarter 2020: teaching at Western Washington University!"
---

We are moving to the Pacific Northwest! I have recently accepted a job offer for a temporary non-tenure track faculty position at [Western Washington University](https://www.wwu.edu/): I'll teach an upper-level undergraduate Genetics lecture course during Winter quarter 2020.  <!--more-->  

I'm currently finishing my postdoctoral work at Maryland trying to (a) get two more projects done, (b) get at least two more papers ready to be submitted, (c) present my lanternfly work at the ESA meeting, and (d) train two undergraduate students in sequence analysis, preparing GenBank submissions, and preparing samples for NGS which they will conduct in Spring. Whew!

All my family is very excited about our move, and I'm looking forward to my new teaching and research adventures!
