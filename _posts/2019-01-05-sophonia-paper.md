title: "The Sophonia paper published!"
---
This paper is on interactions of exotic leafhopper, <i>Sophonia orientalis</i>, with its novel hosts in Hawaii. It took quite a bit to analyze two-year data, to write a manuscript, and to wait for all of the reviewersâ€™ comments. <!--more--> But now it is published in Environmental Entomology! Here is the <a href="{{ 'assets/content/publications/2019_sophonia.pdf' | relative_url }}">paper</a>, and here are we in our departmental [news](https://entomology.umd.edu/news/umd-researchers-study-plant-responses-to-leafhopper-injury). Feels great!
