title: "Our new paper on meta-barcoding of the spotted lanternfly gut contents is published in journal Insects!"

Very happy to see that our [new paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/13/6/534) on meta-barcoding of the spotted lanternfly gut contents is published today in journal Insects, the Special Issue ["Advances on Invasive Insect Pests: Insect Behavior, Host Plant Usage, Biocontrol, and More"](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/insects/special_issues/Invasive_pests) which I co-edit! <!--more--> 

Our study investigated host-plant usage by the first nymphal instars, which are more challenging to find and monitor than other stages. Using DNA metabarcoding of nymphal gut contents (i.e., detection of DNA from multiple ingested plants) in this study we determined and characterized the ingested plants that could be included in a broad host-plant range of early nymphal stages of L. delicatula. This, in turn, have important applications for developing effective management programs to control this invasive pest.
