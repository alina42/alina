title: "Joined the Reviewer Board for journal 'Insects'"
---

I have accepted an invitation to join the [Reviewer Board](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/insects/submission_reviewers) for journal "Insects"! I'll be serving as a reviewer in the following subject areas: molecular gut content analysis, eDNA, DNA barcoding, invasion ecology, plant-insect interactions, insect morphology, and host plant usage. <!--more--> 

I'm happy to continue my long time collaboration with journal "Insects" as an author, reviewer, guest editor, and now a member of the journal's Reviewer Board. I've been enjoying all of my interactions with the editorial board of this journal and I'm always impressed by its timely responses, reviews, interesting special issues, and a speedy publication process!
