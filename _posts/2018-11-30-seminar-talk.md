title: "My first seminar talk"
---
I gave my first talk at our weekly departmental seminar: “Novel plant-insect associations: implication of the lack of coevolution”. It was very exciting and interesting experience, <!--more--> and I got many interesting ideas from the audience on my future research directions. 
My talk is <a href="{{ 'assets/content/publications/2018_seminar_talk.pdf' | relative_url }}">here</a>.
Also, my labmates wrote a very cool [seminar blog](https://entomology.umd.edu/news/protect-or-destroy-the-role-of-native-grasshoppers-in-their-home-habitats) on my talk.
