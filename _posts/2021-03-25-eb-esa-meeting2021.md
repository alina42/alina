This week I presented my research on interspecific and intraspecific interactions of Anastatus reduvii at the [Eastern Branch meeting of the Entomological Society of America](https://esa.confex.com/esa/2021eb/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/153355). <!--more-->In my presentation, I focused on whether (and how) the behavior of A. reduvii changes in the presence of another A. reduvii individual, as well as in the presence of Trissolcus japonicus (a natural enemy of BMSB in Asia).

In this project, using a combination of behavioral trials with A. reduvii on the BMSB egg masses, we recorded and analyzed 13 various types of behavior A. reduvii performed. Our results demonstrated that (a) A. reduvii performed up to four new types of behavior in the presence of other parasitoids; (b) A. reduvii spent significantly less time off the egg mass and more time walking in the presence of another A. reduvii and T. japonicus; (c) A. reduvii spent more time probing/ovipositing on the egg mass in the presence of another A. reduvii than that in the presence of T. japonicus, and (d) in the presence of another A. reduvii, both host-feeding and probing/ovipositing showed significant association with eggs outcome, resulting in ~50% reduction of BMSB hatchlings. We believe that our findings would allow us to better understand interspecific and intraspecific interactions of A. reduvii and, their effect on the BMSB egg fate, which is valuable for developing effective biological control of BMSB.
