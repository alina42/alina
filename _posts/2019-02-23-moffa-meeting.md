Last Saturday I presented at the [Annual Meeting of the Maryland Organic Food & Farming Association](https://marylandorganic.org/events/) (Maryland Dept. of Agriculture, Annapolis, MD). <!--more--> It was a very interesting experience: it was my first formal talk on the spotted lanternfly and its host usage. The spotted lanternfly has not officially invaded Maryland yet (and we hope it will not - only one male individual has been found so far), but it was very important to share all we know about the lanternfly life cycle and behavior with our farmers and growers.  Here is my <a href="{{ 'assets/content/publications/2019_moffa.pdf' | relative_url }}">talk</a>.
