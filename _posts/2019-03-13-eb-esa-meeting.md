title: "Presented at the EB-ESA meeting in Blacksburg!"
---
This week I presented at the [Eastern Branch meeting](https://www.entsoc.org/eastern/2019-branch-meeting) of the Entomological Society of America in Blacksburg, VA. The meeting was very interesting, especially its special symposium on the spotted lanternfly. <!--more--> I enjoyed the talks, and I also was glad to participate in the poster session where I presented my <a href="{{ 'assets/content/publications/2019_EBESA_poster.pdf' | relative_url }}">poster</a> with my current results on the lanternfly external morphology using scanning electron microscopy. I got interesting questions, several discussions, and a lot of valuable ideas. I can't wait to start working on the paper based on our results. Bill and I also organized a symposium on novel plant-insect interactions where I presented all of my projects on grasshoppers feeding preferences on novel host plants (here is my <a href="{{ 'assets/content/publications/2019_EBESA_talk.pdf' | relative_url }}">presentation</a>). The symposium went very well, I really enjoyed all the talks and I'm very grateful to all of our speakers for taking time to present and for basically making this symposium possible. Feels really great!
