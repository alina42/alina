title: "Will serve on the University Senate!"

I'm very grateful and I feel deeply honored to be elected as a PTK senator, to represent the needs, interests, and views of professional track faculty on the University Senate. <!--more--> This is my first experience with this, and I'm really looking forward to serving on the Senate and continuing to contribute to the academic life of our university as much as I can.
