Happy to share that I've moved to my new position. I've joined USDA-APHIS, Biotechnology Regulatory Services (BRS), Biotechnology Risk Analysis Programs (BRAP), Plant Evaluation Branch, as a Biological Scientist. I'll be working on regulatory status documents related to various genetically modified organisms.
