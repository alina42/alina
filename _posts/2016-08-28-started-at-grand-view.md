I am very excited to join Department of Biology at Grand View University in Des Moines, IA as an
adjunct Genetics Instructor!<!--more--> I'll be teaching two sections of an upper-level Genetics
laboratory course for biotechnology majors this Fall, and (hopefully!) Molecular Biology lab in the
Spring.

The university is quite a commute (2 hours from my home, oh well..), but I am really excited about
teaching genetics – one of my favorite courses and research areas. The lab equipment and supplies
are really impressive, small classes, cozy buildings, friendly faculty – I'm very much looking
forward to starting my semester!
