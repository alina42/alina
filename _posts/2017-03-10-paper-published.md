My paper from my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/projects/drosophila-suzukii-raspberry.md %}">postdoctoral work</a> has been just published in Insects, in special issue "Invasive
insect species<!--more-->:

Avanesyan, A., Jaffe, B.D., and C. Guédot (2017) Isolating spermatheca and determining mating status
of the invasive spotted wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii: a protocol for tissue dissection and
its applications. Insects: Special issue “Invasive Insect Species”. 8(1), 32;
doi:10.3390/insects8010032. Invited paper.

This paper describes a step-by-step protocol for tissue dissection, isolating spermathecae, and
determining the mating status of females which I developed specifically for invasive Drosophila
suzukii. 

Many thanks to Claire Mattmiller, a high school student whom I mentored, for numerous fly
dissections she made and several illustrations which have been included in this manuscript.
