title: "Nina succesfully presented at her school research symposium"
---

Last Friday, I enjoyed attending [Eleanor Roosevelt High School Annual Research Symposium](https://www.greenbeltnewsreview.com/news-stories/erhs-symposium-shows-off-students-science-acumen/). Nina, one of my mentees, presented final results of her DNA barcoding work. <!--more-->  This was her year-long project on identification of wetland and stream species of isopods using DNA barcoding. The overall idea of the project was to show whether wetland and stream communities demonstrate biological connectivity. 

Nina presented a poster showing all the steps of the DNA barcoding process she learned during her year-long internship, as well as our current results. Using phylogenetic reconstructions, Nina has pinpointed three unique stream species and two unique wetland species which do not overlap.
