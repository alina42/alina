title: "Our paper on host plant DNA detection from the potato leafhopper gut contents is published!"
---

I'm happy to share that our paper entitled "Detecting Ingested Host Plant DNA in Potato Leafhopper (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae): Potential Use of Molecular Markers for Gut Content Analysis" is published in Journal of Economic Entomology.  <!--more--> In this study we focused on optimizing a DNA-based method for host plant identification of E. fabae and investigating the longevity of the ingested plant DNA as one of the potential applications of the protocol. 

Here is our <a href="{{ 'assets/content/publications/2021_PLH_feeding.pdf' | relative_url }}">paper</a>.
