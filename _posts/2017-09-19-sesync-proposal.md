I've just submitted my proposal for a preliminary review for a postdoctoral fellowship at National
Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) in Maryland.<!--more--> Dr. Bill Lamp kindly offered to be my
collaborative mentor if I get this fellowship. So excited! I'll keep my fingers crossed!

The main idea of my proposal is to analyze the patterns of plant traits (of introduced plants) in
relation to herbivory (A), so that these results can be used to predict insect invasions (B).
Currently, most studies on exotic insects focus on an insect perspective - i.e. feeding preferences,
performance, behavior, etc. In my study, I will propose to use a plant perspective - i.e. plant
defenses - to predict exotic insect behavior. I am especially interested in comparing plants which
were intentionally introduced vs. unintentionally introduced, and invasive vs. exotic non-invasive
plants.
