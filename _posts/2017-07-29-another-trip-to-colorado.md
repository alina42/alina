title: "Yet another trip to Colorado"
---

Last week I spent in Colorado Springs at the Digging Deeper Summer Professional Development workshop
which is part of my Planting Science fellowship I received earlier this year. <!--more--> It was
wonderful experience: I enjoyed meeting biology teachers and other scientist mentors, and I've
learned a lot.  If you would have asked me "Where does the tree mass come from?" a week ago I would
have hard time explaining this! 

We also have a wonderful trip to the Garden of the Gods: red rocks are just gorgeous. Every time I
go to Colorado I discover something new. We also went to a "plant walk", which was a 40 min-walk
from the BSCS building to our hotel accompanied by identification of plants we saw and amazing
stories about them â€“ many thanks to our 'tour guide', Catrina!

I'm looking forward to start working with teachers and their student teams this Fall!
