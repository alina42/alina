Avanesyan, A., and T.M. Culley (2017) Tolerance of native and exotic prairie grasses to herbivory by
Melanoplus grasshoppers: application of a non-destructive method for estimating plant biomass
changes as a response to herbivory. The Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society 144(1):15-25.

That was one of my last experiments on plant responses to grasshopper herbivory which I conducted in
Ohio and Maryland. In this study we wanted to estimate changes in plant biomass (a proxy for plant
tolerance) without clipping the plants. Interestingly, we've found that for the most grasses we used
the predictor variable [plant height x number of leaves] was the best. Most likely it works for
grasses only, but I am curious to see what combination of measurements would work for other plants.
Maybe I will test it in some future experiments..
