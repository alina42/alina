title: "Presented at the 2nd UMD Postdoctoral Research Symposium"
---
Last Friday, I had a poster presentation at our [2nd UMD Postdoctoral Research Symposium](https://gradschool.umd.edu/postdocs/career-and-professional-development/postdoctoral-research-symposium-2019). I presented 'the morphological part' of my lanternfly research â€“ <!--more-->the adaptations of the lanternfly mouthparts and tarsal tips to their host plant usage. I enjoyed both the symposium and the opportunity to present my research. This is the 2nd postdoctoral symposium at the University of Maryland, and I really liked its workshops and the opportunity to meet and talk to other postdoctoral researchers across the university.
