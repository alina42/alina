title: "Starting a postdoc at the University of Maryland"
---

I've just started as a Postdoctoral Associate at the Department of Entomology at the University of
Maryland! <!--more-->This job offer came to me as a wonderful Christmas present, and we packed and moved to
Maryland within 2 weeks.

I am working in <a href="http://www.clfs.umd.edu/entm/lamp/index.html">Dr. Bill Lamp's lab</a>,
where I will continue my research on ecology and evolution of plant-insect interactions. My primary
focus will be novel associations between native and introduced species and their effect on natural
and managed systems. Dr. Lamp has been my mentor for a long time, and we've been collaborating on
several projects since my doctoral studies in Cincinnati. So working in his lab as a postdoc is a
great opportunity for me. 

I'm very excited about my new position, we love our new place in Maryland, and I am looking forward
to my next couple of years in the Lamp lab!
