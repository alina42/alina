title: "Guest lecture on invasive species tomorrow!"
---

I'm very excited about my upcoming guest lecture tomorrow. This lecture is on invasive species for an undegraduate honors class on insect biodiversity.  <!--more-->I gave the similar lecture last year but this year I have considerably modified the lecture content and class activities, I hope the students will enjoy it. I am also looking forward to sharing my latest results from my lanternfly project and showing the preserved samples. 

Here is my <a href="{{ 'assets/content/misc/guest-lecture-2019.pdf' | relative_url }}">lecture</a>, and here is the <a href="{{ 'assets/content/misc/guest-lecture-worksheet-2019.pdf' | relative_url }}">worksheet</a> for the students to follow our class activities.
