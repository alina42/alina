title: "New (or old?) mode of transport for invasive species"

<a href="http://www.care2.com/causes/invasive-species-are-still-hitching-rides-on-tsunami-debris.html">Carlton et al. Science 29 Sep 2017:</a>

<em>"..We document 289 living Japanese coastal marine species from
16 phyla transported over 6 years on objects that traveled thousands of kilometers across the
Pacific Ocean<!--more--> to the shores of North America and Hawaiâ€˜i. Most of this dispersal occurred on
nonbiodegradable objects, resulting in the longest documented transoceanic survival and dispersal of
coastal species by rafting..."</em>

The more I study invasive species the more I realize how little I (we?) know about them: they can
adapt to a new habitat relatively easily, they successfully compete with native species, they
disperse fast, and apparently long distance is also not an obstacle for them!
