title: "Week 5 of Planting Science program"
---

It has been 5 weeks of Planting Science program and my online mentorship of high school
students teams in their plant investigations.<!--more-->

I really enjoy it and I can&#39;t stop being impressed how well everything is organized: all possible
questions I might have are in weekly newsletters, mentors&#39; online resources, or in group
announcements. And if (if!) I can&#39;t find an answer to my question I can always post it on our
forums and will get help right away â€“ literally, within 10-15 min. Amazing!

I&#39;ve been mentoring three research teams so far and I am serving as a liaison for a teacher and her
three student teams. Interactions with students are incredibly rewarding, and I feel very lucky to
be involved in this program!
