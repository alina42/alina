GenBank Accession no. MF074139

Many thanks to my students who did a great job choosing a plant species (in the first place!) for
which a partial sequence for the GAPDH gene (GAPC-2, 1139 bp) previously hasn't been described, and
who, of course, worked hard on isolating and cloning this part of the gene.
