As a teaching assistant at the University of Cincinnati, during 2010-2013 I taught General
Microbiology Laboratory course for biology and pre-med majors. This course included several labs
during which my students conducted group experiments, wrote lab summaries and reports, took several
quizzes and a laboratory exam.

## Topics covered

* Lab # 1: Microscope, mixed bacteria slides, open-plate exercise
* Lab # 2: Aseptic technique, staining, capsule stain demo
* Lab # 3: Gram staining, isolation streaking, motility testing
* Lab # 4: New streak plates, hay infusion slides, flagellar stain demo, acid-fast, endospore staining
* Lab # 5: Measuring cell density, testing oxygen sensitivity; making Winogradsky columns
* Lab # 6: Anaerobes, streak plates for GasPak jars, phage titer
* Lab # 7: Bacterial growth curve, phage-induced lysis
* Lab # 8: MIC determinations, Kirby-Bauer test
* Lab # 9: UV lethality, environmental factors
* Lab # 10: Transfer of DNA between bacteria
* Lab # 11: Known metabolic tests
* Lab # 12: Environmental Sampling; Use of Bergey’s Manual
* Lab # 13: KOH test
* Lab # 14: Inoculate unknown metabolic Tests
* Lab # 15: Koch’s Postulates I
* Lab # 16: Koch’s postulates II
* Lab # 17: Koch’s Postulates III
* Lab # 18: Microbial communities, nutrient cycling; finishing Winogradsky columns
* Lab # 19: Koch’s Postulates IV
* Lab # 20: Synder test
* Lab # 21: Synthetic epidemic
