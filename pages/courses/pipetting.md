If you never tried pipetting before, I highly recommend watching these videos and practicing pipetting. You will learn about different pipettes, corresponding pipette tips, as well as what we call "first stop" and "second stop", and how to use a pipette to transfer reagents. 

You might consider taking the time and practice pipetting different volumes. You could use clear water or colored water. We primarily use three types of pipettes: p1000 (for volumes 100-1000uL), p200 (20-200uL), and p20 (0.1-20uL). Accurate micropipetting using p20 is an especially important skill which will allow you successfully conduct PCR and DNA purification.

Videos were prepared and pipetting was demonstrated by Cameron McPherson (research assistant, Lamp Lab, 2021-2022).
