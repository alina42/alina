excerpt:    "
  This is a new course I've developed and will be happy to teach." 
---


Deliberate introduction of exotic species, as well as accidental invasions and indirect
human-assisted climate change are altering ranges and introducing new overlaps of species. This has
resulted in novel species associations that not only affect trophic interactions locally in natural
and managed communities, but also may often cause widespread economic and environmental problems..


## Learning objectives

**LO#1**: Become familiar with the diversity of invasive species, their ecological adaptations in the introduced range, novel associations with native species, and impact on native communities.
(Bloom's taxonomy levels: "remember", "understand")

**LO#2**: Develop an understanding of the theoretical framework of invasion ecology with a focus on invasion hypotheses, predictive models, and management of invasive species.
(Bloom's taxonomy levels: "understand", "apply")

**LO#3**: Closely examine ecology of native-invasive species interactions using case studies and recognize the complexity of ecological mechanisms underlying novel species interactions.
(Bloom's taxonomy levels: "analyze", "evaluate", "create")

## Learning outcomes

1. After completion of the course students ***need to know***:
* The main ecological characteristics of the invasive species (LO#1)
* Commonly used invasion ecology hypotheses, and how species invasions can be predicted and managed (LO#2)
* The main ecological mechanisms underlying interactions between native and invasive species (LO#3)
2. After completion of the course the students ***will be able to***:
* Differentiate between native, non-native, and invasive species, identify novel species interactions, and name representative invasive plant and animal species (LO#1)
* Describe response of native communities to invaders and identify effective management strategies (LO#2)
* Evaluate consequences of species introductions and develop informative suggestions for mitigating their impact on native communities  (LO#3)

## Learning outcome assessment

* Pre-class assignments: reading assignments, online quizzes, article critiques
* In-class worksheets
* In-class short ungraded quizzes 
* Small-group discussions 
* All-class discussions
* Individual and group presentations  

The course includes weekly lectures and laboratories, weekly homework, 6 online quizzes, as well as a mid-term and cumulative final exam. During both lectures and laboratories students will design and conduct experiments, develop and present group projects, participate in short local field trips, write article critiques, analyze case studies, and develop risk assessment protocols.

## In-class activities

* Interactive lectures: 'yes/no'-cards, in-class worksheet, short all-class discussions
* Guided work in pairs and groups
* Group presentations
* Individual short presentations
* Two local field trips
* Laboratory experiment with plants
* Two article critiques
