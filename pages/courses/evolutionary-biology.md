As an Instructor at the University of Maryland I taught a graduate course in [Evolutionary Biology](https://oes.umd.edu/graduates-post-baccalaureates-professionals/professional-graduate-programs/master-chemical-life-sciences-mclfs/advising-plan-study-mclfs#CLFS609J) during Summer 2019. This is a fully online course offered through the [Master of Chemical and Life Sciences program](https://oes.umd.edu/graduates-post-baccalaureates-professionals/professional-graduate-programs/master-chemical-life-sciences-mclfs?utm_medium=display&utm_source=linkedin&utm_campaign=oes_mclfs&utm_content=mclfs_display&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=oes_mclfs&utm_content=mclfs_search&gclid=Cj0KCQjw19DlBRCSARIsAOnfRehbFayBrGjDxdjTOXcbbEoUtB_YH1qfzXTbt15jorhoZ_3kD8vGa_waAq7AEALw_wcB) (a content-based, professional masterâ€™s degree for middle and high school teachers). This course included 11 online modules (one module per week) which covered various microevolutioanry and macroevolutionary concepts, as well as genetics basics. The course also included a semester-long project, Innovative Classroom Exercise in Evolution (ICEE) - a 80-min lesson based upon material relevant to our course.
