As a teaching assistant at the University of Maryland, during Spring 2018, I taught Honors Seminar [Insect Biodiversity: The Good, the Bad, and the Weird](https://www.universityhonors.umd.edu/seminar_spotlights.html) for non-majors. This course included lectures, wet labs, seminars, and field trips. My students learned and practiced in aquatic insect collection, microscopy, identifying major insect groups and linking insect species to their ecological functions. The students also developed and presented "insect portraits" (fact sheets of  good, bad, or weird insects), and actively participated in guided in-class and online discussions on pollination, plant-insect coevolution, and conservation issues. I also taught a guest lecture on ecology of invasive species.
