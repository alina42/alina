As a Genetics Instructor at Grand View University I taught an upper-level Genetics laboratory course
for biotechnology majors during 2016-2017 academic year. This course included several labs during
which my students conducted experiments, practiced their pipetting skills, wrote lab reports and
made presentations. I trained my students in various molecular biology techniques: human chromosome
spread, bacterial conjugation, complementation test in yeast; DNA extraction, PCR, agarose gel
electrophoresis, restriction digest analysis; sequence analysis, etc. Almost each lab included a
group project.

In addition to their current lab work, during a semester each student group participated in
maintaining Drosophila melanogaster colony, conducted collection of virgin females, sorted males and
females, performed genetic crosses using wild flies and two mutant lines (white and apterous), and
determined phenotypic/genotypic ratios for F1 and F2 offsprings.
