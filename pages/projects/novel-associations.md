In my current postdoctoral work at the University of Maryland (Department of Entomology; [Dr. Bill Lamp’s lab](http://www.clfs.umd.edu/entm/lamp/index.html)) I continue my research on ecology and evolution of plant-insect interactions with a focus on novel associations between native and introduced species. Currently, I am developing several research projects: I am planning to continue exploring herbivore resistance and tolerance in exotic nograsses, a potential role of native insect generalists in biotic resistance of native communities, and, most recently, I’ve started developing a project on host plant usage by a recent invader, the spotted lanternfly.

Project descriptions coming soon..
