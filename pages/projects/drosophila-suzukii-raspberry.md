In my postdoctoral work I studied one of the emerging insect pests – the spotted wing drosophila,
Drosophila suzukii Matsumura (Diptera: Drosophilidae). This is a highly invasive insect species,
which attacks undamaged ripening fruit of a wide variety of soft-skinned fruits and berries. Native
to Southeast Asia, currently it is observed in Europe, North America, and South America. Drosophila
suzukii has demonstrated a very high dispersal capacity and remarkable phenotypic plasticity –
during only a couple of decades since its first introduction in Hawaii, D. suzukii invaded different
temperate regions and now is being monitored in many northern and eastern states, as well as Canada.

I work on several projects on different aspects of D. suzukii biology and population distribution. I
coordinated a multi-state bait comparison project for determining optimal attractants for D.
suzukii. This project was conducted in Minnesota; we set up fly traps with eight different baits and
conducted monitoring of D. suzukii in raspberry during several weeks. I also developed experimental
design for the spatial and temporal distribution project which was supposed to be conducted later in
the season when population of D. suzukii could be established.

I was also actively involved in a project on D. suzukii seasonal phenology focused on overwintering
of D. suzukii and the effect of temperature and humidity on D. suzukii seasonal abundance. We are
currently writing a paper on D. suzukii seasonal phenology which includes an analysis of the
interactions between D. suzukii seasonal abundance and temperature and humidity dynamics during the
collecting seasons in 2014-2015.

Additionally, I developed a protocol for tissue preparation, isolating spermathecae, and determining
mating status of D. suzukii, which we have applied in our bait comparison and phenology studies.
This protocol has been recently published in Insects (Special issue on invasive species). In this
paper, we also demonstrated how this protocol can be applied for both field collected flies and
flies reared in the lab, including fly specimens stored on a long-term basis.
