I worked on this project while I was a part-time researcher at the <a
href="http://www.cytspb.rssi.ru/">Institute of Cytology, RAS</a> in St.  Petersburg, Russia. I
worked at the Laboratory of Cell Biology in Culture under the direction of <a
href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Natalia_Mikhailova">Dr.  Natalia Mikhailova</a>. The
project was on molecular phylogeny and ecological adaptations of the Cerastoderma and the Littorina
snails collected in the intertidal zone of North-European region. We have recently published our
paper on the evidence of hybridization between two species of littoral snails in the intertidal
sites of the Barents Sea, using RAPD nuclear marker.  Peer-Reviewed Publication
