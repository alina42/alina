## DNA barcoding
In my current postdoctoral work at the University of Maryland I've been mentoring several students in DNA barcoding work. This work has been the main part of several ongoing projects in our lab, such as: wetland-stream connectivity; host plant usage of potato leafhoppers and the spotted lanternfly. Recently, we have also started working on molecular diet confirmation of dragonflies and damselflies conducting DNA barcoding from insect feces. I'm training the students in tissue preparation, DNA isolation, PCR, visualization results using gel electrophoresis, as well as sequence analysis and depositing the sequences to the NCBI GenBank datase. I'm also mentoring a student on retrieving data from published studies for our planned systematic review on efficiency of various molecular markers for plant DNA detection within insect gut contents.

<h3> (1) Molecular diet analysis </h3> 
I'm currently mentoring two graduate students and one undergraduate student in their research projects which involve various molecular biology techniques. Two students are working on plant DNA detection from the potato leafhopper and the spotted lanternfly guts: we try to identify insect host plants, confirm their ingestion, and explore insect host plant switch during insect development. The students isolate plant DNA sequences, conduct sequence analysis, and learn how annotate the sequence and deposit it to GenBank.

To date, my mentees have succesfully submitted to GenBank a total of 7 sequences for the chloroplast trnL-gene. All of them have been approved, and some of them are already available in the NCBI GenBank database: 

1. Smith, D.K., Avanesyan, A. and W. O. Lamp. (2019) Eupatorium serotinum tRNA-Leu (trnL) gene, partial sequence; chloroplast. Direct Submission, GenBank Accession no. MN395725
2. Smith, D.K., Avanesyan, A. and W. O. Lamp. (2019) Lonicera maackii tRNA-Leu (trnL) gene, partial sequence; chloroplast. Direct Submission, GenBank Accession no. MN365276
3. Smith, D.K., Avanesyan, A. and W. O. Lamp. (2019) Pisum sativum isolate slf-2 tRNA-Leu (trnL) gene, partial sequence; chloroplast. Direct Submission, GenBank Accession no. MN335637

7. Stancliff, B., Ho, J., Avanesyan, A. and W. Lamp. (2019) Helianthus annuus tRNA-Leu (trnL) gene, partial sequence; chloroplast. Direct Submission, GenBank Accession no. [MK875279](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MK875279.1)


Four of these sequences were obtained by my former mentee, Bryan, a high school student!

Bryan was working with us during last Spring semester, and I was really impressed by his incredible progress during those several months. Bryan joined us in January knowing nothing about wet lab techinques for DNA barcoding process; he worked once a week only learning all the steps; and by the end of April he had successfully extracted genomic DNA from 100+ leafhopper samples, amplified plant DNA from leafhopper guts and succesfully obtained and deposited four plant sequences. His work was the essential part of our paper on the use of molecular markers for plant DNA detection from leafhopper gut contents (the manuscript is currently submitted). 

**Update** - 09/23/19: I was very pleased to learn recently that Bryan was admitted to the University of Maryland where he continues studying Molecular Biology. 

Bryan was also featured in [The John Carroll School News](https://www.facebook.com/johncarrollschool/photos/a.549607655156223/2147147948735511/?type=3&theater). 

I'm so happy for him!

<h3> (2) Wetland-stream connectivity: DNA barcoding of isopods </h3> 

'Wetland-stream connectivity' connectivity is yet another exciting project; my mentee, Nina, a high school student, is creating a reference library of mitochondrial sequences from stream isopod species - we will then BLAST sequences from wetland isopod individuals against this library to determine the matches and estimate how 'close' wetland species are to stream species. 

**Update** - 02/22/19: Nina presented her research project earlier this week at her school's science fair and got 3rd prize! So exciting!

**Update** - 05/25/19: Nina was admitted to the University of Maryland where she will study Environmental Science and Policy. Very exciting! She is continuing, however, her work on DNA barcoding of isopods this summer, learning and improving the phylogenetic reconstructions for our isopod samples.

## Microscopy
During my postdoctoral work at the University of Wisconsin-Madison I trained a high school student in tissue dissection and isolation, slide preparation, tissue and cell identification, morphological analysis. Claire did a research project on the spotted wing drosophila through the Biotechnology Youth Apprenticeship program. Claire learned how to use a new protocol I developed for dissecting fly tissues and determining fly mating status. She successfully applied this new technique to different fly specimens; she also created beautiful illustrations for an invited manuscript which we published later in Insects. Here are some of the figures Claire made for our <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28287438">paper</a>:

Additionally, Claire compiled a large dataset for temperature and humidity data we used in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ee/article-abstract/47/6/1365/5159616">another paper</a> on the effect of temperature and humidity on the seasonal phenology of the spotted wing drosophila.

## PlantingScience Mentor


As a [PlantingScience fellow](https://plantingscience.org/members/5520/profile), during summer/fall 2017 I participated in the [PlantingScience program](https://plantingscience.org/) (Botanical Society of America; Digging Deeper project). I was an online scientist mentor and liaison for student research teams (high school and middle school students).

That was my first year with the PlantingScience program. I really enjoyed our summer workshop in Colorado Springs and meeting with biology teachers from around the country, as well as our wonderful trip to the Garden of the Gods. Last Fall, I was a scientist mentor for nine research teams and a liaison for a biology teacher and three research teams in her class. The student teams which I mentored, focused on [The Power of Sunlight](https://plantingscience.org/posinformation) module and conducted their independent research projects on plant photosynthesis and respiration. 

Since then, I stayed with PlantingSceince, and I've been serving as a scientist mentor every semester. During Fall 2018, I worked as a member of Master Plant Science Team serving  as a liaison for one class and a mentor for three student teams. Great experience! I'm continously looking forward to being a part of this interesting program every semester!

## Animal Ecology
In 2003, at Herzen State University, I started teaching a course on Animal Ecology. Since then, I’ve supervised the research of
several undergraduate students, including short projects (as a part of their independent research),
as well as their final theses (a Diploma in Russian academia) <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/courses/animal-ecology-students.md %}">...more
