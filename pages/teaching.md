## Mentoring undergraduate students

In 2003 I started teaching a course on Animal Ecology. Since then, I’ve supervised the research of
several undergraduate students, including short projects (as a part of their independent research),
as well as their final theses (a Diploma in Russian academia).

Some of the popular focus areas of such projects included the effect of anthropogenic factors on the
morphology and diversity of freshwater snails; soil mesofauna under anthropogenic press; and
population characteristics of aquatic invertebrates.

The main idea of these projects was to study the level of ecological contamination on the territory
of North-West region of Russia. We collected invertebrates on the territory of our Department’s
field station (located in the south-west of St.Petersburg Region) and nearby water reservoirs.
Students learned how to identify organisms, conduct simple morphometric measurements, and apply
basic biomonitoring methods. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/courses/animal-ecology-students.md %}">...more
