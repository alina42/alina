I have a very diverse academic background: I have studied and worked at seven different instituations in two countries. I have taught
various biological courses (as both an instructor of record and teaching assistant); I have also developed new courses, and I have mentored a variety of students in their independent research projects. My research interests lie primarily in the area of evolution and ecology of species interactions. I’ve done most of my research on host-parasite and plant-insect interactions, and I’ve also worked on some aspects of population genetics, and phylogenetics. 

I earned my Diploma and, later, my Candidate of Science degree in Biological Sciences at [Herzen State University](https://www.herzen.spb.ru/en/About_University) in St. Petersburg, Russia. I worked on cellular immune responses of pulmonate snails to infection by trematodes using Biomphalaria glabrata snails and Echinostoma caproni trematode as a model. After completing my degree in 2002 I joined the faculty at Herzen State University. As faculty, I taught a variety of lectures and laboratories, and worked with my undergraduate students on their research. In 2008, I spent a semester as a visiting research scholar at the Biology Department at the University of Northern Iowa, where I received training in molecular biology techniques and worked on phylogeography and genetic variation in Uca crab populations. The following academic year (2008/09), while still at Herzen, I became a part-time researcher at The Institute of Cytology in St. Petersburg, where I continued my training in molecular biology and worked on genetic hybridization of littoral snails.

I continued my education as a doctoral student at the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Cincinnati. My research areas included phylogenetic relationships of forensically important flies, plant-insect interactions (which became the focus of my dissertation), as well as aspects of plant population genetics. I earned my Ph.D. in Biological Sciences in 2014, under the direction of [Dr. Theresa Culley](http://homepages.uc.edu/~culleyt/CulleyLab.html). In my dissertation, I focused on interactions between native and exotic grasses and generalist insect herbivores, using a grasses-grasshoppers model and combining molecular approach and behavioral experiments. 

In 2016, I did a short postdoc at the Department of Entomology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, focusing on seasonal phenology and biology of the invasive spotted wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii. Then, during 2016/2017 academic year, I was a Genetics Instructor at Grand View University where I taught upper-level Genetics and Molecular Biology laboratory courses for biotechnology majors. 

Since January 2018, I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the Department of Entomology at the University of Maryland. I am working in [Dr. Bill Lamp’s lab](http://www.clfs.umd.edu/entm/lamp/index.html), where I continue my research on ecology and evolution of plant-insect interactions with a focus on novel associations between native and introduced species. Currently, I'm involved in various projects; I'm working on external morphology and host plant usage of the invasive spotted lanternfly using molecular approach, light microscopy, and scanning microscopy; I'm exploring host plant usage of the potato leafhopper using molecular markers for ingested plant DNA; I'm also using DNA barcoding of isopods as a tool to assess wetland-stream connectivity. I'm participating in some other lab projects, too, and I'm also mentoring several students in different DNA barcoding projects. All this is super exciting!

Outside my work I enjoy spending time with [my husband](http://ic4f.me) and our little daughter. We enjoy the outdoors whenever we get a chance – hiking, biking, skiing, and simply exploring new places! And if the weather isn’t cooperating, you will find me exploring the unpredictable worlds of Neil Gaiman, J.R.R. Tolkien, and George Martin, enjoying new adventures with Stephen Hunter, or looking for all those who disappeared and “were said to been seen in San-Francisco” with Armistead Maupin…
