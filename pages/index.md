  I am a biology researcher. I have worked primarily on species interactions (host-parasite and
  plant-insect interactions), population genetics, and phylogenetics. In my research, I have
  integrated molecular biology approaches, field and laboratory experiments, as well as microscopy and
  histological techniques."
