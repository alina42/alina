<p>Our study investigated host-plant usage by the first nymphal instars, which are more challenging to find and monitor than other stages. Using DNA metabarcoding of nymphal gut contents (i.e., detection of DNA from multiple ingested plants) in this study we determined and characterized the ingested plants that could be included in a broad host-plant range of early nymphal stages of L. delicatula. This, in turn, have important applications for developing effective management programs to control this invasive pest.</p>

<p>In this study, we conducted field and greenhouse experiments to explore plant resistance and tolerance to grasshopper herbivory in five cultivars of Miscanthus sinensis. The results of this project demonstrated that plant responses varied among the cultivars during a season; all the cultivars, but “Zebrinus”, demonstrated a significant increase in plant tolerance by the end of the growing season regardless of the amount of sustained leaf damage. Different patterns in plant responses from “solid green” and “striped/spotted” varieties were recorded, with the lowest plant resistance detected for “Autumn Anthem” in the cage experiment. Our results have important applications for monitoring low-risk invaders in protected areas, as well as for biotic resistance of native communities to invasive grasses.</p>

  <p>I’m happy to share my little (so far!) collection of my nature drawings with a heavy focus on insect drawings, of course!   <!--more--> I always loved to draw but last year I started drawing insects. I love it! At first, I’ve decided to draw my favorite study species only, but it is hard to resist drawing anything beautiful I see. So my collection extended to some other insect species and plants. Last January, I took an online course “Drawing Nature, Science and Culture: Natural History Illustration 101”, a course of study offered by NewcastleX, an online learning initiative of The University of Newcastle. I proudly completed all the assignments (some of them are below) and earned a <a href="/assets/content/misc/certificate.pdf">certificate</a>. The drawing of the eastern gray squarel was my final exam drawing.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/totodor">my page</a> at deviantart.com where I post my new drawings as I finish them. This and last week two of my drawings, the spotted lanternfly and the silver maple, were featured at <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/thepencilclub">ThePencilClub</a> - group. So exciting!</p>

<p>In our systematic review, we were specifically focused on the following questions:
(1) What insect groups were used for detecting ingested plant species using a PCR-based approach?
(2) Which DNA extraction methods have been used for detecting plant DNA from insect guts? 
(3) Which DNA regions have been shown to allow for successful identification of plant species? 
(4) How is the presence of the targeted plant DNA fragment verified?</p>

<p>Our results showed that among five insect orders used in the retrieved studies Coleoptera and Hemiptera were prevalent (33 and 28% of all the records, respectively). In 79% of the studies a DNA barcoding approach was employed. In a substantial number of studies Qiagen DNA extraction kits and CTAB protocol were used (43 and 23%, respectively). Of all records, 65% used a single locus as a targeted plant DNA fragment; trnL, rbcL, and ITS regions were the most frequently used loci. Sequencing was the dominant type of among DNA verification approaches (70% of all records). This review provides important information on the availability of successfully used PCR-based approaches to identify ingested plant DNA in insect guts, and suggests potential directions for future studies on plant–insect trophic interactions.</p>

  <p>I’ve finished developing the main outline of my course in Invasion Ecology which I hope to teach some day. This is a semester-long course; I see it as an upper-division undergraduate course but I think it can be easily adapted for a low-division undergraduate course or an elective graduate course. <!--more--></p>

<p>Invasion ecology is a fascinating area to me: Why do some introduced species become invasive? Why do some introduced species fail to establish? What can we do to learn more about invasive species?, etc. All these questions have been driving my research since my doctoral studies at the University of Cincinnati. This course has been my ‘pet’ project since then, and I developed it based on both my own research and teaching experience.</p>

<p>I’ve designed this course to include weekly lectures and laboratories, weekly homework, online quizzes, as well as a mid-term and cumulative final exam. During both lectures and laboratories students would design and conduct experiments, develop and present group projects, participate in short local field trips, write article critiques, analyze case studies, and develop risk assessment protocols. I’d like my future students to gain all this experience and see themselves as scientists in training during that semester.</p>

<p>The course outline with examples of lecture slides, assignments and worksheets are available <a href="http://alinaavanesyan.com/courses/invasion-ecology">here</a>.

This paper summarizes the results of my work on molecular confirmation of diet of the spotted lanternfly. In this study we showed, for the first time, that host plant DNA can be identified within the gut contents of the spotted lanternfly and demonstrated the use of this approach for deciphering the host plant range of the lanternfly. I’m very happy to get it done and be able to share. I’m also very thankful to Darsy, Jessica, and Nurani - my mentees and great helpers - who helped me with routine DNA extraction, sequence editing, and depositing sequences to NCBI GenBank.</p>

  <p>I was very pleased to know that our grant proposal entitled “Identification of host plant use by the invasive spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) using next-gen DNA sequencing technology” has been funded by Maryland Agricultural Experiment Station Competitive Grant Program! <!--more--></p>

<p>For this one-year study, we have proposed using a next-generation sequencing technology (‘Amplicon-EZ’) for meta-barcoding plant species from the gut contents of the invasive spotted lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula. Our current findings of plant DNA detection from the gut contents of the lanternfly nymphs using Sanger sequencing (Avanesyan and Lamp, manuscript is in preparation) suggest that while the observed lanternfly nymphs actively move on a host plant they may not utilize it for feeding. A substantial number of the nymphs (~90%) we have analyzed showed the ingested DNA from a host plant other than the plant from which the nymphs were collected. However, Sanger sequncing allowed us to detect and identify only DNA from one unique ingested plant. Conducting meta-barcoding of the lanternfly gut contents will allow us to detect multiple plant DNA fragments and detangle all possible associations with the host plants.</p>

<p>To date, we have successfully sequenced the gut content from one lanternfly nymph which yielded 139 ingested plant sequences. Among these fragments 12% were readable (i.e. long enough to use the BLAST engine in GenBank and identify the species), and among the readable ones - 12% were from the Bartramiaceae family, and 88% were from the Lamiaceae family. A substantial number of these plants are non-woody species which is very interesting (and important!) as the spotted lanternfly is considered to be a predominant tree pest. Looking forward to our work on this grant and more sequencing!!</p>

<p>It has been challenging and very interesting work. In this study, we focused on assessing changes in morphology of (a) the lanternfly mouthparts (stylets and labium), and (b) the lanternfly tarsal tips (arolia and tarsal claws) at each developmental stage. Our study revealed several interesting developmental patterns which potentially allow L. delicatula to better attach to a host plant and deeper penetrate to the host plant tissues at the late nymphal stages and adult stage. Here they are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The labium in adults consists of five segments whereas the nymphs have four labial segments</li>
  <li>The labium and stylet length, as well as the tarsal claw dispersal from the arolium, exponentially increase by 4th- instar nymph and adult stage</li>
  <li>Mandibular stylets possess four indentations on the outer surface of the stylet apical part which become more evident in 4th-instar nymphs and adult</li>
  <li>Longitudinal striations between indentations are present on mandibular stylets of 4th-instar nymphs and adults</li>
  <li>Arolia surface becomes wrinkled in late instars and adults</li>
  <li>Changes in the angle of arolium growth follow the quadratic growth curve; the angle becomes obtuse in adults which potentially causes increase of the arolia basal width</li>
  <li>Additionally, we have found six morphological types of sensilla which are present at the labial tip at each developmental stage of L. delicatula; which potentially indicates the lanternfly ability to effectively explore the host plant suitability at each developmental stage.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is the first study on variation in the lanternfly external morphology across various developmental stages, and our findings are critical for investigating and predicting the lanternfly host range, and the lanternfly dispersal to new host trees at each developmental stage.</p>

These images helped us to explore how <!--more--> different structures of the lanternfly mouthparts and tarsi change during the lanternfly development,  and I’m very excited to start working on our new paper on the external morphology of the spotted lanternfly in relation to its host plants.</p>

<p>In this study we specifically focused  on the structures which are responsible for primary contact of the spotted lanternfly with host tree surface (i.e. stylets, labium, tarsal claws, and arolia). We observed several interesting patterns:</p>

<p><strong>Mouthparts</strong> - oval prominences and longitudinal striations on the mandibular stylets are more defined in 4th instar and adults; labium is more segmented in adults; numerous sensilla, including the bristle-like sensilla, on the tip of the labium are present at each developmental stage.</p>

<p><strong>Tarsal tips</strong> - tarsal claws are more spread out in adults; arolia are fully developed at each stage; arolia surface becomes more wrinkled in adults.</p>

<p>We think that observed patterns are adaptations to host plant usage and correspond with a type of host plants utilized at each developmental stage, and we would like to focus on morphometric comparisons of mouthparts and tarsi next. Can’t wait for these new results!</p>

<p>This systematic review entitled “<a href="/assets/content/publications/2018_should_i_eat.pdf">Should I eat or should I go? Acridid grasshoppers and their novel
host plants: potential for biotic resistance</a>” 
aimed to identify patterns of grasshopper feeding preferences for native versus introduced plants
and, consequently, a potential of grasshoppers to provide biotic resistance of native communities.
I’ve worked on this review for a total of almost 2 years: I collected 2146 studies (from six
databases) published during 1967–2017. Only 13 studies satisfied all of my inclusion criteria; from
these, I was able to extract 63 records of feeding preference trials for 28 North-American
grasshopper species. These trials involved direct comparison between consumed native and introduced
plant material, and these records were included in the analysis.</p>

<p>I’m going to present a poster on this paper at the upcoming ESA meeting in Vancouver, CA. So I
discussed with my PI the best way of presenting it since it is virtually impossible to fit all the
details and analysis in one poster. His advice was very simple: to present the main message I’d like
to tell people and support it with evidence. I was thinking about this one message, and I came up
with five(!) things which were the most surprising for me and which I definitely would want to
share:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Acridid grasshoppers prefer to feed on introduced plants.</li>
  <li>Most of these plants are highly invasive.</li>
  <li>Grasshoppers prefer to feed on them regardless the experimental conditions (greenhouse, field,
etc.) or plant material offered (clipped leaves, stems, plants in pots, etc.).</li>
  <li>The authors use a very wide range of measurements. From 63 records I counted 35 different
measurements the authors used to assess grasshopper preferences.</li>
  <li>Most of these measurements were not standardized. Only 12 out of 35 measurements were
standardized in some way (by time or grasshopper weight).</li>
</ol>

<p>I collected these data and wrote the main parts of these manuscript while we lived in Iowa.  So the
graphical abstract (see above) is special for me: it is a shot of a grasshopper eating our palm tree
on our balcony in Iowa, on the 3rd floor!</p>

<h2 id="back-to-plantingscience">Back to PlantingScience!</h2>

<p>I’m very happy to be back to the <a href="http://alinaavanesyan.com/planting-science/">PlantingScience program</a>, this time as a member of the <a href="https://plantingscience.org/groups/mpst">Master Plant
Science Team</a>! I will serve as a liaison for one class of high school students and as a scientist
mentor for 2-3 teams. I had incredibly rewarding experience participating in the Digging Deeper
project last year and I’ve decided to stay with PlantingScience forever!  I’m very much looking
forward to continuing my work with teachers and students this academic year and together with them
enjoy science!</p>

<h2 id="maes-proposal-funded">MAES proposal funded!</h2>

<p>And last but not least was that one of our two lanternfly proposals has been funded by
<a href="https://agresearch.umd.edu/">The Maryland Agricultural Experiment Station</a>, McIntire Stennis Forestry Research Program. These news
came as a wonderful surprise on Friday, Aug 31 late afternoon (the last possible day for such
notifications) with the starting date Sep 1. This is super exciting, my work on the spotted
lanternfly began a few months ago, now we have some preserved specimens, and I don’t have to wait
anymore to ‘officially’ start exploring them. More details to come!</p>

  <p>We had a wonderful time on campus celebrating our annual <a href="https://marylandday.umd.edu/">Maryland Day</a>! I was really impressed how
well everything was organized and how many things there were to do with friends and family, and of
course with little and not so little kids. <!--more-->We came there for 2 hours and stayed for the whole day!
My daughter enjoyed our insect petting zoo very much, although she refused to touch the tarantula
(well, I don’t blame her); but “scooping bugs” was by far her favorite thing to do. She also was
fascinated with all the insect models and stickers with insects; and of course she immediately
“borrowed” the toy-grasshopper from my office desk once she had spotted it.</p>

<p>We tried some other things, too: we got to the barn where we touched sheep and watched beautiful
horses. Ice-cream, a balloon, a police cap, lots of candies, and wonderful weather were included!
This was the first time I took my daughter to my work - she said she liked it very much, and I’m
pretty sure she thinks now that my work is Maryland Day every day!</p>

  <p>Being almost exclusively ‘terrestrial’ person in my research it has been quite an interesting
experience for me to “get wet” with both Dr. Lamp’s lab and his Aquatic Entomology class. <!--more-->
Although I am a TA in this class I fully participate in all the student activities. It’s fun, but
also I can’t stop being surprised of how different things are under water. Well, here are my first
impression:</p>

<p>The first surprise for me was the fact that apparently there is no such thing as “traditional”
plant-insect interactions in aquatic communities. Everyone (all insects) eats almost everything (all
leaves which fall in a stream), and all “tastes” the same as long as it provides enough nutrients.</p>

<p>I also didn’t know that it is not a leaf itself that attracts aquatic insects, but a biofilm - a
bunch of different microorganisms which stick to each other and to a surface of a leaf. I learned
that “the leaf with such biofilm for aquatic insects is like a toast with peanut butter for us: a
toast itself is edible of course, but with peanut butter it is a completely different food”
(borrowed from Becca W.)</p>

<p>Below are some pictures from my first collections and insect identifications.</p>

<p>April, 2018 – this is exclusively for kids, of course. It has several themed rooms – our daughter
enjoyed playing with water, construction tools, blocks, pretend snakes in the pretend rainforest,
and even a little theatre. Finally we all enjoyed playing outside on a very original playground with
a castle and a hidden slide which for some reason reminded me of the slopes in Colorado.</p>

park has a lot of different trails with beautiful views. So we are looking forward to exploring it
more. Nevertheless, the weather was beautiful, and we were glad to spend a couple of hours hiking
and exploring all the sticks and pine cones our daughter could find (extremely hard task). I was
also on watch out for the spotted lanternfly, but nothing so far. Not yet, I guess..</p>

stories about them – many thanks to our ‘tour guide’, Catrina!</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to start working with teachers and their student teams this Fall!</p>

who, of course, worked hard on isolating and cloning this part of the gene.</p>

  <p>Today my students presented their molecular biology term projects at 4th Annual Grand View
Scholarship Symposium. Very exciting! <!--more-->We were very nervous at the beginning of the semester when we
started cloning the GAPDH gene from cilantro and rosemary (my students’ plant choice!) It was a very
challenging project: sometime a time period of a lab was simply not enough to finish PCR or check
bacterial growth. Students did a good job coming to the lab after or between classes to take care of
their samples. Many thanks to our lab administrator, Jennifer Donnelly, and the department head,
Idit Hazan, for their help with preparing samples and taking care of plants, as well as all the
supplies we needed during the semester.</p>

<p>Anything could have gone wrong at any time, but here we go, we have three beautiful posters and 13
happy students who are proud of their work:</p>

<p>Furthermore, sequence of the GAPDH gene from rosemary, turned out to be particularly good, and we
are currently preparing it for submission to NCBI GenBank. Feels great!</p>

<p>That was one of my last experiments on plant responses to grasshopper herbivory which I conducted in
Ohio and Maryland. In this study we wanted to estimate changes in plant biomass (a proxy for plant
tolerance) without clipping the plants. Interestingly, we’ve found that for the most grasses we used
the predictor variable [plant height x number of leaves] was the best. Most likely it works for
grasses only, but I am curious to see what combination of measurements would work for other plants.

<p>It will come out in February 2014. This paper describes a protocol for isolating plant food DNA from
insect guts, developed specifically for grasshoppers. It is a very convenient and relatively quick
PCR-based method which allows accurate confirmation of food consumption by insect herbivores. Given
that grasshoppers are important agricultural pests and dominate insect herbivores in the grasslands,
knowledge of their feeding preferences is critical for both crop management and landscape
restoration.</p>

<p>The paper includes this video which I made to illustrate the main steps of dissecting a grasshopper.</p>

<p>I am currently applying this protocol to exploring grasshoppers’ feeding choices with regard to
native and exotic plant species, which is another application of this method – to help managers to
effectively control invasive plants and/or predict invasion.</p>

<div class="ic4f-blog-list-content">
  <p>Last summer I started my grasses/grasshoppers feeding experiments in the field. The main problem I
had to solve was building the cages.<!--more--></p>

<p>The cages had to be high enough to accommodate the plants. They also had to be low enough so that I
wouldn’t lose my grasshoppers there. I also needed some sort of a separator to divide the cage into
two halves – for control plants and plants with grasshoppers. From literature, I knew that the cage
should be metal, so that grasshoppers won’t chew through it and escape. Also, there should be screen
walls – to let enough light into the cage (both for plants and grasshoppers).</p>

<p>After some searching I ended up using open air aluminum screen cages (16×16×20″ Repti Breeze
Aluminum Screen Cage, Zoo Med Laboratories, Inc., California, USA). These cages are meant for
keeping reptiles, but their material, size, and shape were exactly what I needed.</p>

<p>First I removed the bottom of the cage (it is just a plastic plate).</p>

<div class="row">

    </figure>
  </div>
</div>

<p>For a separator I used a small regular window screen – you can find those in Lowe’s or Home Depot,
they are cheap. You can assemble your own, but I found one that was the perfect size for my cages.
On both sides of the separator I attached a thick window sealant strip – so that it fit tightly
against the screen walls of the cage and did not leave any holes for grasshoppers to move across the
cage and feed on control plants – and ruin my data.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/blog/cage3.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="" /></p>

<p>I placed some extra soil inside the cages to cover all possible holes at the bottom. It is a good
idea to add even more soil than is needed: if it rains part of the soil will get washed out,
uncovering new holes. I also added more soil outside along the edges of the cages.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/blog/cage4.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="" /></p>

<p>I started my experiments by placing two different grass species in each half of the cage, but this
year I will be planting four different grasses – I expect them to fit (UPDATE: they did fit
perfectly!) I would not go with more than four though…</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/blog/cage5.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="" /></p>

<p>These are field experiments – so fixing cages to the ground is another problem. I used two ropes and
four metal hooks; this proved to be very stable, even during heavy rain and strong wind.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/blog/cage6.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="" /></p>

<p>The cages turned out to be very convenient not only for field experiments but also for a temporarily
keeping grasshoppers in the lab (I usually keep them in the greenhouse). The cages have two doors,
and the lowest one is designed specifically for cleaning the cage without disturbing the reptiles –
that works for grasshoppers, too! I also often use this door for placing new grasshoppers in the
cage; they tend to jump up when released in the cage from a collecting bag and this way they will
not escape.</p>

<p>I hope this might be useful to someone who conducts similar experiments.</p>

<div class="ic4f-blog-list-content">
  <p>I liked the idea of <a href="/blog/2012/12/the-board-is-your-friend/">writing a lab flow
on the board</a> so much, that soon I started to add “Next lab assignment” rubric as well. As I
usually need all space on the board during the lab, <!--more--> I’ve decided to write a homework
assignment for the next lab in the right top corner of the board. I never need that space, whereas
my students always know where to find the assignment.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/blog/board2.jpg" class="border-0 img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="" /></p>

<p>I started writing the assignment soon after a few students asked me several times about the
homework. It was an unexpected question for me; usually all assignments are posted on the course
webpage and are listed in the student’s lab manual along with all deadlines. I thought maybe it
would be helpful if I would remind them every time what they should focus on for their homework:
things such as, for example, reading chapter 3, pre-lab for week 2, bring your computers/textbooks
etc.</p>

<p>Again, I’ve found this to be helpful for students: they can ask more specific questions about the
homework before they actually start doing it at home. Also, I’ve noticed that a few students from
time to time started doing their homework in class. It was the students who finished the lab earlier
than the rest of the class and didn’t want to waste the remaining time.</p>

<p>It made me think that they considered the “next lab” note as a continuation of the lab flow that I
write on the board. On one hand, it is a good connection between the homework and material covered
in class: the students can start doing the homework while they still remember the lab and have an
opportunity to discuss it with their classmates and me. On the other hand, I am a little bit
concerned about the quality of their work when they are working so fast. I am still thinking.</p>

<p>As for my teaching side, writing the homework assignment helped me emphasize things in the lab flow
which students should focus on during the lab and which will help them later in their homework. This
approach definitely decreased the amount of questions about the type of the assignments; instead we
focus more on specific questions related to the homework’s content. In fact I have almost stopped
worrying about how well my students understand their homework assignments, not to mention the
decreasing of amount of emails with general questions. :-)</p>

<p>Also, I started thinking about what else I could put on the board to help me in class. Since I used
a projector very often for different information, I couldn’t have any notes displayed on the screen
for the duration of the lab. Also, I was worried that additional notes on the board might be
  unnecessary. So I started watching my explanations during the lab and marked (in my mind) the
  typical moments when I actually need to use the board.</p>

<p>It turned out that the most often I referred to the board when I needed a scheme explaining the
order of steps of an experiment: liquid from what tube goes to what tube, what we add to the tube,
etc. Another typical situation when I needed the board were group projects: dividing
responsibilities between groups and group members. Since then each time I am dealing with a complex
experiment or group work I use the remaining space to write what I think is important for the
current lab. I’ve found that besides saving time and organizing the work, these notes also provide
visual cues for students for understanding the guidelines in the lab manual, as well as seeing their
own impact in any team project.</p>

  <p>I teach biology labs. Our typical lab usually includes a short lecture, a discussion about homework
(so called pre-labs), a wet lab (i.e., an experiment), and exercises or answering questions.
<!--more-->Having so many activities I found myself trapped in the situation where I have to explain
the next lab phase to students while some of them are still working and are not listening to me.
Even those who had finished the previous lab phase were not paying attention to me because of the
noise from the others. I didn’t feel comfortable at all: I was rather helpless and quite
unimportant. Besides, my teaching is also complicated by my accent: I am afraid that even if my
students hear me, they won’t be able to figure out what I’m trying to explain.</p>

<p>Such situations were not very comfortable in my past either – even when I taught in my native
language. One simple solution for professors in my native country was to speak louder – eventually
all students would start looking at her and listening to the lecture. We were used to it as
students, we did it later as professors. There were, of course, different versions of this approach:
to speak very loud, to pause the lecture, or, as yet another option, I remember one professor used
to start whispering when students continued to talk. I tried some of these approaches, but I didn’t
like any of them. I thought all of them were artificial ways to attract students’ attention to what
the professor had to say.</p>

<p>Over the years, I started thinking that such situations simply will not occur if the professor
naturally attracts students’ attention by doing and/or telling something interesting, as well as by
keeping students (and herself!) busy and organized during the class.</p>

<p>Keeping this in mind I looked for ways to prevent these uncomfortable situations from happening, as
well as ways to reduce the possibility of students misunderstanding me due to my accent. One day I
followed the suggestion of one of my professors about a particularly complicated lab: she suggested
writing the lab flow on the board. Which I did.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/content/blog/board1.jpg" class="border-0 img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="" /></p>

<p>I told my students that when they had finished one part of the lab they could look at the board for
what to do next. If I needed to give an explanation before each task, I waited until everyone
started doing the task, I would then ask them to pause and listen to my brief explanation, and then
they would continue. I’ve noticed that it helped me and students to be more organized; as a result,
I had less pauses in class.</p>

<p>Writing the lab flow on the board for that complicated lab was helpful. In fact, it proved helpful
for any lab. Since then I have been writing flows for each lab, even the simple ones with few
activities. I have also realized that it is important to make my writing as clear and legible as
possible and to refer to the lab flow on the board often; otherwise, students simply wouldn’t pay
attention to what I wrote. The last bullet in the lab flow is especially important: it means the end
of the class – at which point students know what they should turn in before they go, what needs to
be cleaned up, etc.</p>

<p>Based on feedback from students, this lab flow idea is helpful for them as well. Thinking back to my
past teaching experiences, I wish I knew this at that time. I am sure this simple approach would’ve
helped me keep students’ attention and make their learning experience more enjoyable.</p>

  <p>At the end of each semester I receive students evaluations. It was a very difficult moment for me
when I had just started teaching in the US. Mostly because there is no such thing as students
evaluations in my native country.<!--more--> It was one of many new things for me. I felt awful when
I first saw “she struggled with explaining concepts”, or “she was quiet and I couldn’t hear her”, or
“she graded hard”, or even better “she didn’t answer the questions and couldn’t conduct
discussions”…</p>

<p>I know that it is not only me who feels uncomfortable reading a bad review from students. A
professor I knew joked that she usually drinks a bottle of wine before sitting down to read her
evaluations. Someone else told me that students always complain about professors and he didn’t want
to know what they wrote about him. At a conference, I heard that some TAs simply stopped reading
evaluations, while others never even opened them.</p>

<p>I understand such feelings. I also have things I am afraid of. I am afraid that students will not
understand my accent; I am afraid I’ll have to ask them to repeat the question several times until I
get it. Terrible feeling. I am afraid that I indeed will not know the answer and students will infer
that I might not know other things as well. However, one of the things I am not afraid of is to open
and to read student evaluations. I am even looking forward to them. Here is why.</p>

<p>First, people don’t want to read bad things in the reviews, but they forget that there are also good
things there. There is always a question “what do you like in your professor/TA?” in any evaluation;
and there are always some good things in the answer. Anyone, I think, would like to read something
good about themselves. I know I would.</p>

<p>Second, reading evaluations is part of my job. It just needs to be done. Like grading, for example.
It is my responsibility as a TA (and as a future professor) to read student evaluations and to use
this information to improve my teaching.</p>

<p>And, finally, I think it is again a question of respect for my students and their time. My students
spent time answering the questions in the survey and writing their reviews. I have to appreciate
that.</p>

<div class="ic4f-blog-list-content">
  <p>In my very first evaluation that I received from my students here in the US I saw this comment:
<strong><em>she is very straightforward</em></strong>.</p>

<p>I wasn’t sure what that meant. <!--more-->At first I thought it was just a language thing: I didn’t
have a large vocabulary during my first year of doctoral study, so teaching was often difficult.
Sometimes I wasn’t sure how to explain a concept, sometimes I didn’t know how to ask a question, or
make a comment, or ask students to do this or that – using the right, appropriate words. These
things seem simple enough, but for me they were not simple, especially during my first semester of
teaching in a new country.</p>

<p>Very straightforward. Was I not polite enough? I certainly didn’t mean to. In my next semester I
tried to use words like <span class="ic4f-highlight">“could you please”</span>, or <span class="ic4f-highlight">“would you like”</span> more often. However, another problem came about: now
every time before asking students to do something I had to think about how to ask them. Since I was
still working on improving my English (and still working!), that took some serious effort! But it
seemed like I was solving the problem.</p>

<p>Today it is easier for me to talk to my students. I am much more comfortable answering their
questions, helping them when they are wrong and encouraging them when they are right. I know I try.
However, when it comes to giving them specific feedback on grading, my hard times return.</p>

<p>I thought about this over and over, trying to understand the roots of the problem. I think it cannot
be just language.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s a culture thing? After all, I’m from another country. I recalled the time when I was a
professor in my native country and realized that I never worried about how to communicate with my
students. And here’s why: the important thing was the amount of knowledge the professor had. The
amount of knowledge meant authority; how to share that knowledge with the students was secondary.
And overall, the teaching process was more strict: students didn’t have much freedom; they didn’t
change advisors, committees, research topics, or their majors very easily – if at all. That must
have reflected on the way professors talked to students and how students talked – or, better,
listened – to their professors.</p>

<p>But I think there’s something else – not just using the right words. After all, memorizing the words
I should (or shouldn’t) use with students didn’t really help much. So here’s my “big idea”: I think
the words reflect how I see myself, my status – comparing to how I see the status of my students,
and what I think of them. Do I think that I know everything on a given topic much better than they
will ever know; and does this give me a special right to talk to them from this position of
superiority? Or do I think of them as future colleagues who just happen to be studying what I had
studied earlier, and maybe later some of them will know this subject deeper than I do – after it
becomes their research area? Essentially, it is a question of respect: the more I respect my
students – the easier it is for me to talk to them. Even when I need to provide detailed feedback on
harsh grading. Because I think that, for them, obtaining such feedback is very much like, for me,
obtaining feedback from my professors on my own research: they always want me to change this or
that, but I also know they want to help me and they want me to succeed. Right?</p>

<p>And thus, the problem of finding the right words slowly went away. But I still need to work on my
vocabulary.</p>

<h2 id="original-post">Original Post</h2>

<p>I called my blog Professor Sprout because I teach biology, conduct research on plants, and love the
Harry Potter books!</p>

<p>At Hogwarts, each year students learn something new. Each year they meet new teachers. Each year
they are exposed to different teachers’ personalities and different teaching methods. Eventually,
some of the students become teachers themselves – and return to Hogwarts to teach new students who
arrive each year to start their own journey of discovery!</p>

<p>I love this stuff. I’ve lived in “the world of academia” for many years. In my native country
overseas I’ve come a long way – from first-year student to university professor. A few years ago
I’ve started a similar journey in the United States, which has become my new home. This time I am a
doctoral student, once again studying to become a university professor. Although this time I feel
different – not only because I am older or because I speak a different language. Having went through
some twists and turns along the way, I have started to think much more about how I study, and how I
teach, and what I can do to become a happy and successful professor here in America.</p>

<p>I have decided to start this blog in hopes that it will help me find a balance between my previous
experience and the new knowledge I’m discovering. My blog will be about different things; things
which have an effect on my teaching, my research, and the way I advance towards my degree. By
sharing my thoughts through this blog, I hope to better understand what kind of professor I actually
want to become during this new academic journey.</p>

<p>So let’s see where the Hogwarts Express takes me and what new stations I am about to discover!</p>
