<p class="ic4f-blog-list-excerpt">I teach biology labs. Our typical lab usually includes a short lecture, a discussion about homework
(so called pre-labs), a wet lab (i.e., an experiment), and exercises or answering questions.

<p class="ic4f-blog-list-excerpt">At the end of each semester I receive students evaluations. It was a very difficult moment for me
when I had just started teaching in the US. Mostly because there is no such thing as students
evaluations in my native country.

<p class="ic4f-blog-list-excerpt">In my very first evaluation that I received from my students here in the US I saw this comment:

<p class="ic4f-blog-list-excerpt">At first this blog was anonymous. It lived at www.professorsprout.me – an address which
captured my attachment to biology and, yes, the Harry Potter books. Eventually I decided to move it to
this new website that has a more formal name. But I’m keeping my first post unchanged – with all its Harry Potter
references – for the sake of a little bit of magic.
