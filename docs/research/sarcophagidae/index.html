      <p>I conducted this project in Dr. Ron DeBry’s lab at the beginning of my doctoral program at the
University of Cincinnati. Flies of the Sarcophagidae family are known as forensically important
insects; that is why studies of their identification and systematic relationships are critically
important. The phylogenetic analysis which included mtDNA (COI, COII and ND4) provided good
resolution for most nodes. However, the mtDNA gene tree might not be identical to the species tree,
so it was necessary to obtain additional data from nuclear genes. Such new data might increase the
support for the mtDNA tree or support a different phylogeny. Our results showed that adding nuclear
PER gene in most cases maintained or improved support in the Bayesian Inference tree. However, we
also find support for some novel relationships.</p>

<p>As a side project, I also worked on host-parasite interaction between sarcophagid flies and
grasshoppers. Grasshoppers cause significant damage to crops and rangeland which leads to economic
losses in the US and worldwide. Chemical insecticides are traditionally used to prevent
grasshoppers’ outbreaks but these chemicals are harmful to the ecosystem and are costly for pest
managers. Parasitic flesh flies are one promising approach to biological control of grasshoppers.
Fly larvae have a noticeable impact on reproductive physiology and survival of grasshoppers. This
topic had potential applications for biological control of grasshoppers. I went on two collection
trips to Montana and Iowa and maintained grasshoppers in the lab to observe the presence of
parasitoids. However, I did not detect any, which might be explained by a relatively low natural
infection rate (&lt;3%). I continued to work with current literature, which contained controversial
information about this host-parasite model and I tried to figure out what species of flies can
infect what species of grasshoppers based on North-American experimental studies.  Conference
