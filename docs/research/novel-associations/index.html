        <h1 class="ic4f-main-heading">Novel plant-insect associations; implications of the lack of coevolution</h1>
      
      <p>In my current postdoctoral work at the University of Maryland (Department of Entomology; <a href="http://www.clfs.umd.edu/entm/lamp/index.html">Dr. Bill
Lamp’s lab</a>) I continue my research on ecology and
evolution of plant-insect interactions with a focus on novel associations between native and
introduced species. Currently, I am developing several research projects: I am planning to continue
exploring herbivore resistance and tolerance in exotic grasses, a potential role of native insect
generalists in biotic resistance of native communities, and, most recently, I’ve started developing
a project on host plant usage by a recent invader, the spotted lanternfly. A brief description for
each project is below. I will be adding more details as the projects develop.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="should-i-eat-or-should-i-go-acridid-grasshoppers-and-their-novel-host-plants">Should I eat or should I go: acridid grasshoppers and their novel host plants</h2>
<p>This is a systematic review I’ve been working on for the past year, and now it is almost ready for
submission - so exciting! The review  aimed to identify patterns of grasshopper feeding preferences
for native versus introduced plants and, consequently, grasshopper potential for biotic resistance
of native communities, that (as the review has shown) is surprisingly overlooked in experimental
studies on invasion ecology.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="herbivore-resistance-in-miscanthus-sinensis-cultivars">Herbivore resistance in Miscanthus sinensis cultivars</h2>
<p>Although exotic chinese silver grass, a gorgeous ornamental plant and important biofuel source, can
be highly invasive in some states, not all of its cultivars are invasive. I am currently designing
my field and greenhouse experiments for the upcoming summer season to explore plant resistance to
grasshopper herbivory and how this resistance differs among Miscanthus cultivars, and whether the
initially introduced wild type demonstrates the highest level of herbivore resistance.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="plant-dna-detection-within-gut-contents-in-sap-feeding-insects">Plant DNA detection within gut contents in sap-feeding insects</h2>
<p>Plant DNA detection in insect gut contents is one of the most accurate ways to confirm host plant
utilization, determine insect diet and interactions with other organisms. Most of the previous
studies that involved molecular analysis of insect gut contents were primarily conducted on
leaf-chewing insects, such as beetles, moths, or grasshoppers. Sap-feeders could be more challenging
for molecular analysis of their gut contents because phloem sap presumably doesn’t contain plant
DNA. However, this method was shown to be effective for potato psyllids (Cooper et al 2016) -
apparently, while feeding an insect stylet (a piercing mouthpart) can consume not only phloem sap
but can also pick up some of the surrounding plant cells which allows DNA to be detected in the
insect gut contents. In this project, we would like to investigate whether (and how) we can apply
this method for yet another sap-feeder, the potato leafhopper, to explore its host plant usage.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="biodiversity-of-agricultural-drainage-ditches">Biodiversity of agricultural drainage ditches</h2>
<p>I’ve recently joined this ongoing project in Dr. Lamp’s lab, and I am currently ‘torturing’
herbarium plant specimens hoping that they will speak and tell me their taxonomic identity. Having
almost zero previous experience in plant identification, so far I have barely advanced to plant
family level (with the aid of textbooks and technology). A lot to learn, a lot to do…</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="host-plant-usage-of-the-spotted-lanternfly">Host plant usage of the spotted lanternfly</h2>
<p>I am currently working on a grant proposal where we propose to study the spotted lanternfly (SLF)
and its interaction with host plants. This emerging invasive insect pest is currently rapidly
spreading in the eastern US, moving closer and closer to Maryland. This is a completely new study
species for me, and while reading more and more about it I can’t stop being amazed by SLF unique
ecology and behavior.</p>
