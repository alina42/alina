      <p>In my current postdoctoral work at the University of Maryland (Department of Entomology; <a href="http://www.clfs.umd.edu/entm/lamp/index.html">Dr. Bill
Lamp’s lab</a>) I’m interested in
ecology and evolution of plant-insect interactions, and primarily novel interactions between native and
introduced species. This is a continuation of my previous postdoctoral work at Wisconsin and doctoral
research at Cincinnati. I’m curious what mechanisms (behavioral, molecular, physiological, etc.) drive
such novel interactions, and how introduced species become invasive in natural and managed systems.
Currently, I’m working on a variety of projects that involve DNA barcoding, microscopy, morphometric analysis, phylogenetics, field and greenhouse work. The topics include (a) host plant
usage of the potato leafhopper based on molecular markers for ingested plant DNA; (b) DNA
barcoding in isopods; (c) biodiversity of agricultural drainage ditches; (d) herbivore resistance and
tolerance in exotic grasses; and (e) external morphology and host plant usage of the invasive spotted
lanternfly using molecular approach, light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. A brief description for some of my projects is below. I will be adding more details as the projects grow.</p>

<h2 id="host-plant-usage-of-the-spotted-lanternfly-morphological-adaptations--molecular-confirmation-of-diet">Host plant usage of the spotted lanternfly: morphological adaptations + molecular confirmation of diet</h2>
<p>I’ve been working on the spotted lanternfly (SLF) since last Spring. This emerging invasive insect pest is currently rapidly
spreading in the eastern US, and it has been detected in Maryland in October 2018. Our two grant proposals on studying SLF external morphology and its host plants were recently funded by MDA and MAES (yay!) and now I’m spending almost half of my time in the microscope room and the SEM laboratory. I’m curious to see how the lanternfy’s mouthparts and tarsi are so well adapted to feeding and moving on its host trees. Also, I”m about to try our DNA barcoding protocol we’ve developed for another sap-feeder, the potato leafhopper, to confirm the lanternfly’s host plants.  Almost a year later, since I started studying this species, I can’t stop being amazed by SLF unique ecology and behavior.</p>

<h2 id="plant-dna-detection-within-gut-contents-in-sap-feeding-insects">Plant DNA detection within gut contents in sap-feeding insects</h2>
<p>Plant DNA detection in insect gut contents is one of the most accurate ways to confirm host plant
utilization, determine insect diet and interactions with other organisms. Most of the previous
studies that involved molecular analysis of insect gut contents were primarily conducted on
leaf-chewing insects, such as beetles, moths, or grasshoppers. Sap-feeders could be more challenging
for molecular analysis of their gut contents because phloem sap presumably doesn’t contain plant
DNA. However, this method was shown to be effective for potato psyllids (Cooper et al 2016) -
apparently, while feeding an insect stylet (a piercing mouthpart) can consume not only phloem sap
but can also pick up some of the surrounding plant cells which allows DNA to be detected in the
insect gut contents. In this project, we would like to investigate whether (and how) we can apply
this method for yet another sap-feeder, the potato leafhopper, to explore its host plant usage.</p>

<p>This is an ongoing project in Dr. Lamp’s lab. Using isopods from multiple wetland sites and streams in Maryland Delmarva Bays Wetlands we explore the potential connectivity between wetland and stream communities. Morphological identification of isopod species is tricky, and DNA barcoding, which I’m focusing on, is very helpful for estimating how ‘close’ wetland isopod species are to the isopod species inhabiting streams. I’m currently mentoring three students in this DNA barcoding work, and together with my mentees we isolate and sequence a portion of mitochondrial gene, cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1), create a reference library of these sequences, and using a BLAST search engine in the NCBI GenBank database we assess species and genera identity of isopods.</p>

<p>This is a systematic review I was working on last year (manuscript submitted). The review aimed to

has shown) is surprisingly overlooked in experimental studies on invasion ecology.</p>

<h2 id="biology-and-distribution-of-invasive-drosophila-suzukii-in-raspberry-previous-postdoctoral-work">Biology and distribution of invasive Drosophila suzukii in raspberry (previous postdoctoral work)</h2>

<p>In my postdoctoral work at the University of Wisconsin-Madison I studied one of the emerging insect pests – the spotted wing drosophila,
Drosophila suzukii Matsumura (Diptera: Drosophilidae). This is a highly invasive insect species,
which attacks undamaged ripening fruit of a wide variety of soft-skinned fruits and berries. Native
to Southeast Asia, currently it is observed in Europe, North America, and South America. Drosophila
suzukii has demonstrated a very high dispersal capacity and remarkable phenotypic plasticity –
during only a couple of decades since its first introduction in Hawaii, D. suzukii invaded different
temperate regions and now is being monitored in many northern and eastern states, as well as Canada.</p>

<p>I work on several projects on different aspects of D. suzukii biology and population distribution. I
coordinated a multi-state bait comparison project for determining optimal attractants for D.
suzukii. This project was conducted in Minnesota; we set up fly traps with eight different baits and
conducted monitoring of D. suzukii in raspberry during several weeks. I also developed experimental
design for the spatial and temporal distribution project which was supposed to be conducted later in
the season when population of D. suzukii could be established.</p>

<p>I was also actively involved in a project on D. suzukii seasonal phenology focused on overwintering
of D. suzukii and the effect of temperature and humidity on D. suzukii seasonal abundance. We are
currently writing a paper on D. suzukii seasonal phenology which includes an analysis of the
interactions between D. suzukii seasonal abundance and temperature and humidity dynamics during the
collecting seasons in 2014-2015.</p>

<p>Additionally, I developed a protocol for tissue preparation, isolating spermathecae, and determining
mating status of D. suzukii, which we have applied in our bait comparison and phenology studies.
This protocol has been recently published in Insects (Special issue on invasive species). In this
paper, we also demonstrated how this protocol can be applied for both field collected flies and
flies reared in the lab, including fly specimens stored on a long-term basis.</p>
