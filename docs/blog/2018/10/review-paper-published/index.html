      <p class="ic4f-blog-date">– October 11, 2018</p>
      <p>My systematic review and meta-analysis on feeding preferences of acridid grasshoppers on native vs.
introduced plants has just been published in <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/7/4/83">Plants, Special Issue “Plants Interacting with other
Organisms: Insects”</a>.<!--more--> It has been quite a long and challenging process with 3 rounds of
revision and incorporating comments from 5(!) reviewers, but I’m really excited to see it published.</p>

<p>This systematic review entitled “<a href="/assets/content/publications/2018_should_i_eat.pdf">Should I eat or should I go? Acridid grasshoppers and their novel
host plants: potential for biotic resistance</a>” 
aimed to identify patterns of grasshopper feeding preferences for native versus introduced plants
and, consequently, a potential of grasshoppers to provide biotic resistance of native communities.
I’ve worked on this review for a total of almost 2 years: I collected 2146 studies (from six
databases) published during 1967–2017. Only 13 studies satisfied all of my inclusion criteria; from
these, I was able to extract 63 records of feeding preference trials for 28 North-American
grasshopper species. These trials involved direct comparison between consumed native and introduced
plant material, and these records were included in the analysis.</p>

<p>I’m going to present a poster on this paper at the upcoming ESA meeting in Vancouver, CA. So I
discussed with my PI the best way of presenting it since it is virtually impossible to fit all the
details and analysis in one poster. His advice was very simple: to present the main message I’d like
to tell people and support it with evidence. I was thinking about this one message, and I came up
with five(!) things which were the most surprising for me and which I definitely would want to
share:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Acridid grasshoppers prefer to feed on introduced plants.</li>
  <li>Most of these plants are highly invasive.</li>
  <li>Grasshoppers prefer to feed on them regardless the experimental conditions (greenhouse, field,
etc.) or plant material offered (clipped leaves, stems, plants in pots, etc.).</li>
  <li>The authors use a very wide range of measurements. From 63 records I counted 35 different
measurements the authors used to assess grasshopper preferences.</li>
  <li>Most of these measurements were not standardized. Only 12 out of 35 measurements were
standardized in some way (by time or grasshopper weight).</li>
</ol>

<p>I collected these data and wrote the main parts of these manuscript while we lived in Iowa.  So the
graphical abstract (see above) is special for me: it is a shot of a grasshopper eating our palm tree
on our balcony in Iowa, on the 3rd floor!</p>
