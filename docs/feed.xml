Bryan was working with us during last Spring semester, and I was really impressed by his incredible progress during those several months. &lt;!--more--&gt;  Bryan joined us in January knowing nothing about wet lab techinques for DNA barcoding process; he worked once a week only learning all the steps; and by the end of April he had successfully extracted genomic DNA from 100+ leafhopper samples, amplified plant DNA from leafhopper guts and succesfully obtained and deposited four plant sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is the first author on four GenBank submissions which were approved and are currently available in the NCBI GenBank database:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stancliff, B., Avanesyan, A. and W. Lamp. (2019) Vicia faba var. major tRNA-Leu (trnL) gene, partial sequence; chloroplast. Direct Submission, GenBank Accession no. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MK934667.1&quot;&gt;MK934667&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stancliff, B., Smith, D., Avanesyan, A. and W. Lamp. (2019) Pisum sativum tRNA-Leu (trnL) gene, partial sequence; chloroplast. Direct Submission, GenBank Accession no. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MK919208.1&quot;&gt;MK919208&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stancliff, B., Abdelwahab, O., Avanesyan, A. and W. Lamp. (2019) Vigna unguiculata tRNA- Leu (trnL) gene, partial sequence; chloroplast. Direct Submission, GenBank Accession no. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MK883492.1&quot;&gt;MK883492&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stancliff, B., Ho, J., Avanesyan, A. and W. Lamp. (2019) Helianthus annuus tRNA-Leu (trnL) gene, partial sequence; chloroplast. Direct Submission, GenBank Accession no. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MK875279.1&quot;&gt;MK875279&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His work was the essential part of our paper on the use of molecular markers for plant DNA detection from leafhopper gut contents (the manuscript is currently submitted).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bryan was also featured in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/johncarrollschool/photos/a.549607655156223/2147147948735511/?type=3&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;The John Carroll School News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m co-editing this special issue with Dr. Bill Lamp. Our proposal for this special issue has been approved, and the special issue has just been announced  &lt;!--more--&gt; on the journal’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Special Issue welcomes recent research on plant and animal DNA detection in the gut contents of insect herbivores and predators, respectively, as well as insect DNA detection in the gut contents of their predators, vertebrate or invertebrate. DNA-based protocols, short experimental reports, and original research articles, as well as review papers that broadly cover issues relating to molecular gut content analysis of various insect species (leaf-chewing insects, sap-feeders, soil-dwelling insects, etc.) and insect predators (both invertebrates and vertebrates) are of interest for this Special Issue. Studies that utilize both basic and advanced molecular biology methods are invited for submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deadline for the submission is March 15, 2020. I’m planning to contribute to this special issue with some results of my DNA barcoding work, and I’m looking forward to receiving new submissions!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’m serving as a Guest Editor for journal Insects, Special Issue “Molecular Gut Content Analysis: Deciphering Trophic Interactions of Insects”.

Last week I successfully amplified and sequenced COI partial gene from dragonfly feces produced during the first 2 hours post ingestion. The sequence analysis with subsequent BLAST results showed that the prey item was a crane fly. Surprisingly enough the DNA from the crane fly wasn’t degraded and an isolated fragment of 667 bp showed good sequence quality. These exciting results can make identification of dragonfly prey possible and accurately confirm (or even poitn to new) trophic interactions in dragonfly natural habitats.&lt;/p&gt;

I got interesting questions, several discussions, and a lot of valuable ideas. I can’t wait to start working on the paper based on our results. Bill and I also organized a symposium on novel plant-insect interactions where I presented all of my projects on grasshoppers feeding preferences on novel host plants (here is my &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/content/publications/2019_EBESA_talk.pdf&quot;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt;). The symposium went very well, I really enjoyed all the talks and I’m very grateful to all of our speakers for taking time to present and for basically making this symposium possible. Feels really great!&lt;/p&gt;

The meeting was very interesting, especially its special symposium on the spotted lanternfly.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Scanning Electron Microscopy: Round 2</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/03/SEM-images/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Scanning Electron Microscopy: Round 2" /><published>2019-03-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-03-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/03/SEM-images</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/03/SEM-images/">&lt;p&gt;I’ve finished the 2nd round of scanning electron microscopy of the lanternfly mouthparts and tarsi which I conducted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.umd.edu/core-facilities/bio-ultrastructure&quot;&gt;The Laboratory for Biological Ultrastructure&lt;/a&gt; (my special thanks to Tim Maugel for his continuous help!!). We received beautiful SEM images, most of them are included now in &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/content/publications/2019_EBESA_poster.pdf&quot;&gt; my poster&lt;/a&gt; for the upcoming EB-ESA meeting. These images helped us to explore how &lt;!--more--&gt; different structures of the lanternfly mouthparts and tarsi change during the lanternfly development,  and I’m very excited to start working on our new paper on the external morphology of the spotted lanternfly in relation to its host plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study we specifically focused  on the structures which are responsible for primary contact of the spotted lanternfly with host tree surface (i.e. stylets, labium, tarsal claws, and arolia). We observed several interesting patterns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mouthparts&lt;/strong&gt; - oval prominences and longitudinal striations on the mandibular stylets are more defined in 4th instar and adults; labium is more segmented in adults; numerous sensilla, including the bristle-like sensilla, on the tip of the labium are present at each developmental stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tarsal tips&lt;/strong&gt; - tarsal claws are more spread out in adults; arolia are fully developed at each stage; arolia surface becomes more wrinkled in adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think that observed patterns are adaptations to host plant usage and correspond with a type of host plants utilized at each developmental stage, and we would like to focus on morphometric comparisons of mouthparts and tarsi next. Can’t wait for these new results!&lt;/p&gt;
