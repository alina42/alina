&lt;p&gt;Our study investigated host-plant usage by the first nymphal instars, which are more challenging to find and monitor than other stages. Using DNA metabarcoding of nymphal gut contents (i.e., detection of DNA from multiple ingested plants) in this study we determined and characterized the ingested plants that could be included in a broad host-plant range of early nymphal stages of L. delicatula. This, in turn, have important applications for developing effective management programs to control this invasive pest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, we conducted field and greenhouse experiments to explore plant resistance and tolerance to grasshopper herbivory in five cultivars of Miscanthus sinensis. The results of this project demonstrated that plant responses varied among the cultivars during a season; all the cultivars, but “Zebrinus”, demonstrated a significant increase in plant tolerance by the end of the growing season regardless of the amount of sustained leaf damage. Different patterns in plant responses from “solid green” and “striped/spotted” varieties were recorded, with the lowest plant resistance detected for “Autumn Anthem” in the cage experiment. Our results have important applications for monitoring low-risk invaders in protected areas, as well as for biotic resistance of native communities to invasive grasses.&lt;/p&gt;

I love it! At first, I’ve decided to draw my favorite study species only, but it is hard to resist drawing anything beautiful I see. So my collection extended to some other insect species and plants. Last January, I took an online course “Drawing Nature, Science and Culture: Natural History Illustration 101”, a course of study offered by NewcastleX, an online learning initiative of The University of Newcastle. I proudly completed all the assignments (some of them are below) and earned a &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/content/misc/certificate.pdf&quot;&gt;certificate&lt;/a&gt;. The drawing of the eastern gray squarel was my final exam drawing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deviantart.com/totodor&quot;&gt;my page&lt;/a&gt; at deviantart.com where I post my new drawings as I finish them. This and last week two of my drawings, the spotted lanternfly and the silver maple, were featured at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deviantart.com/thepencilclub&quot;&gt;ThePencilClub&lt;/a&gt; - group. So exciting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our systematic review, we were specifically focused on the following questions:
(1) What insect groups were used for detecting ingested plant species using a PCR-based approach?
(2) Which DNA extraction methods have been used for detecting plant DNA from insect guts? 
(3) Which DNA regions have been shown to allow for successful identification of plant species? 
(4) How is the presence of the targeted plant DNA fragment verified?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our results showed that among five insect orders used in the retrieved studies Coleoptera and Hemiptera were prevalent (33 and 28% of all the records, respectively). In 79% of the studies a DNA barcoding approach was employed. In a substantial number of studies Qiagen DNA extraction kits and CTAB protocol were used (43 and 23%, respectively). Of all records, 65% used a single locus as a targeted plant DNA fragment; trnL, rbcL, and ITS regions were the most frequently used loci. Sequencing was the dominant type of among DNA verification approaches (70% of all records). This review provides important information on the availability of successfully used PCR-based approaches to identify ingested plant DNA in insect guts, and suggests potential directions for future studies on plant–insect trophic interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a semester-long course; I see it as an upper-division undergraduate course but I think it can be easily adapted for a low-division undergraduate course or an elective graduate course. &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Invasion ecology is a fascinating area to me: Why do some introduced species become invasive? Why do some introduced species fail to establish? What can we do to learn more about invasive species?, etc. All these questions have been driving my research since my doctoral studies at the University of Cincinnati. This course has been my ‘pet’ project since then, and I developed it based on both my own research and teaching experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve designed this course to include weekly lectures and laboratories, weekly homework, online quizzes, as well as a mid-term and cumulative final exam. During both lectures and laboratories students would design and conduct experiments, develop and present group projects, participate in short local field trips, write article critiques, analyze case studies, and develop risk assessment protocols. I’d like my future students to gain all this experience and see themselves as scientists in training during that semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course outline with examples of lecture slides, assignments and worksheets are available &lt;a href=&quot;http://alinaavanesyan.com/courses/invasion-ecology&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
I’m currently exploring online alternatives for experimental laboratories and field trips. I really enjoyed developing this course, and I know I’ll enjoy even more teaching it some day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Invasive spotted lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula, my current primary research object. We know so little about this unusual and one of the most aggressive forest insect pests in the eastern US.
