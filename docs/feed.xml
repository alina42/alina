introduced plants has just been published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/7/4/83&quot;&gt;Plants, Special Issue “Plants Interacting with other
Organisms: Insects”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;!--more--&gt; It has been quite a long and challenging process with 3 rounds of
revision and incorporating comments from 5(!) reviewers, but I’m really excited to see it published.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This systematic review entitled “&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/content/publications/2018_should_i_eat.pdf&quot;&gt;Should I eat or should I go? Acridid grasshoppers and their novel
host plants: potential for biotic resistance&lt;/a&gt;” 
aimed to identify patterns of grasshopper feeding preferences for native versus introduced plants
and, consequently, a potential of grasshoppers to provide biotic resistance of native communities.
I’ve worked on this review for a total of almost 2 years: I collected 2146 studies (from six
databases) published during 1967–2017. Only 13 studies satisfied all of my inclusion criteria; from
these, I was able to extract 63 records of feeding preference trials for 28 North-American
grasshopper species. These trials involved direct comparison between consumed native and introduced
plant material, and these records were included in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to present a poster on this paper at the upcoming ESA meeting in Vancouver, CA. So I
discussed with my PI the best way of presenting it since it is virtually impossible to fit all the
details and analysis in one poster. His advice was very simple: to present the main message I’d like
to tell people and support it with evidence. I was thinking about this one message, and I came up
with five(!) things which were the most surprising for me and which I definitely would want to
share:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acridid grasshoppers prefer to feed on introduced plants.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most of these plants are highly invasive.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grasshoppers prefer to feed on them regardless the experimental conditions (greenhouse, field,
etc.) or plant material offered (clipped leaves, stems, plants in pots, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The authors use a very wide range of measurements. From 63 records I counted 35 different
measurements the authors used to assess grasshopper preferences.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most of these measurements were not standardized. Only 12 out of 35 measurements were
standardized in some way (by time or grasshopper weight).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I collected these data and wrote the main parts of these manuscript while we lived in Iowa.  So the
graphical abstract (see above) is special for me: it is a shot of a grasshopper eating our palm tree
on our balcony in Iowa, on the 3rd floor!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">My systematic review and meta-analysis on feeding preferences of acridid grasshoppers on native vs. introduced plants has just been published in Plants, Special Issue “Plants Interacting with other Organisms: Insects”.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Summer News!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/09/summer-news/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Summer News!" /><published>2018-09-08T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-09-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/09/summer-news</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2018/09/summer-news/">&lt;p&gt;Summer is over. It was a busy Summer - full of interesting work, trips, and a lot of writing.
Looking back, I’m happy to share a few highlights.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;subject-editor-for-the-journal-of-orthoptera-research&quot;&gt;Subject Editor for the Journal of Orthoptera Research!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago I’ve been offered to serve as a Subject Editor for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jor.pensoft.net/browse_journal_groups.php?role_id=3&amp;amp;journal_name=jor&quot;&gt;Journal of Orthoptera
Research&lt;/a&gt;. It was super exciting! I served as a reviewer for this journal before for about 2 years,
and I really enjoyed it. I also constantly refer to this journal in my research since it is the only
journal we have so far where you can find everything about grasshoppers in one place!  My editing
work is in a full mode now - I’ve been editing the manuscripts in the areas of Biodiversity &amp;amp;
Conservation, General Ecology, and Molecular Biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also very happy to be featured in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailchi.mp/5b6be1cff4e3/department-of-entomology-newslettersummer-2018?e=d62b3d56d4&quot;&gt;departmental
newsletter&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;planning-umd-postdoctoral-research-symposium&quot;&gt;Planning UMD Postdoctoral Research Symposium..&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the past summer, I served on the planning committee for the first (ever!) &lt;a href=&quot;https://gradschool.umd.edu/postdocs/career-and-professional-development/postdoctoral-research-symposium&quot;&gt;UMD Postdoctoral
Research
Symposium&lt;/a&gt;. The symposium is almost here (on Sep 17), we’ve planned several interesting
workshops (getting grants, designing a new course, etc.) - should be fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;back-to-plantingscience&quot;&gt;Back to PlantingScience!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very happy to be back to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://alinaavanesyan.com/planting-science/&quot;&gt;PlantingScience program&lt;/a&gt;, this time as a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plantingscience.org/groups/mpst&quot;&gt;Master Plant
Science Team&lt;/a&gt;! I will serve as a liaison for one class of high school students and as a scientist
mentor for 2-3 teams. I had incredibly rewarding experience participating in the Digging Deeper
project last year and I’ve decided to stay with PlantingScience forever!  I’m very much looking
forward to continuing my work with teachers and students this academic year and together with them
enjoy science!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;maes-proposal-funded&quot;&gt;MAES proposal funded!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last but not least was that one of our two lanternfly proposals has been funded by
&lt;a href=&quot;https://agresearch.umd.edu/&quot;&gt;The Maryland Agricultural Experiment Station&lt;/a&gt;, McIntire Stennis Forestry Research Program. These news
came as a wonderful surprise on Friday, Aug 31 late afternoon (the last possible day for such
notifications) with the starting date Sep 1. This is super exciting, my work on the spotted
lanternfly began a few months ago, now we have some preserved specimens, and I don’t have to wait
anymore to ‘officially’ start exploring them. More details to come!&lt;/p&gt;

I was really impressed how
well everything was organized and how many things there were to do with friends and family, and of
course with little and not so little kids. &lt;!--more--&gt;We came there for 2 hours and stayed for the whole day!
My daughter enjoyed our insect petting zoo very much, although she refused to touch the tarantula
(well, I don’t blame her); but “scooping bugs” was by far her favorite thing to do. She also was
fascinated with all the insect models and stickers with insects; and of course she immediately
“borrowed” the toy-grasshopper from my office desk once she had spotted it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried some other things, too: we got to the barn where we touched sheep and watched beautiful
horses. Ice-cream, a balloon, a police cap, lots of candies, and wonderful weather were included!
This was the first time I took my daughter to my work - she said she liked it very much, and I’m
pretty sure she thinks now that my work is Maryland Day every day!&lt;/p&gt;

experience for me to “get wet” with both Dr. Lamp’s lab and his Aquatic Entomology class. &lt;!--more--&gt;
Although I am a TA in this class I fully participate in all the student activities. It’s fun, but
also I can’t stop being surprised of how different things are under water. Well, here are my first
impression:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first surprise for me was the fact that apparently there is no such thing as “traditional”
plant-insect interactions in aquatic communities. Everyone (all insects) eats almost everything (all
leaves which fall in a stream), and all “tastes” the same as long as it provides enough nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also didn’t know that it is not a leaf itself that attracts aquatic insects, but a biofilm - a
bunch of different microorganisms which stick to each other and to a surface of a leaf. I learned
that “the leaf with such biofilm for aquatic insects is like a toast with peanut butter for us: a
toast itself is edible of course, but with peanut butter it is a completely different food”
(borrowed from Becca W.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are some pictures from my first collections and insect identifications.&lt;/p&gt;

growing little one. &lt;!--more--&gt; I was glad to find out that here in Maryland we could find plenty of
such opportunities within an hour-drive from home, and often less than that.  Here are the places we
have visited so far. Our daughter was super excited about each of them and if she could she would go

&lt;p&gt;April, 2018 – this is exclusively for kids, of course. It has several themed rooms – our daughter
enjoyed playing with water, construction tools, blocks, pretend snakes in the pretend rainforest,
and even a little theatre. Finally we all enjoyed playing outside on a very original playground with
a castle and a hidden slide which for some reason reminded me of the slopes in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April, 2018 – we apparently went not to the best trail for kids, but according to what I’ve read the
park has a lot of different trails with beautiful views. So we are looking forward to exploring it
more. Nevertheless, the weather was beautiful, and we were glad to spend a couple of hours hiking
and exploring all the sticks and pine cones our daughter could find (extremely hard task). I was
also on watch out for the spotted lanternfly, but nothing so far. Not yet, I guess..&lt;/p&gt;

Maryland! &lt;!--more--&gt;This job offer came to me as a wonderful Christmas present, and we packed and moved to
Maryland within 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am working in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clfs.umd.edu/entm/lamp/index.html&quot;&gt;Dr. Bill Lamp’s lab&lt;/a&gt;,
where I will continue my research on ecology and evolution of plant-insect interactions. My primary
focus will be novel associations between native and introduced species and their effect on natural
and managed systems. Dr. Lamp has been my mentor for a long time, and we’ve been collaborating on
several projects since my doctoral studies in Cincinnati. So working in his lab as a postdoc is a
great opportunity for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very excited about my new position, we love our new place in Maryland, and I am looking forward

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy it and I can't stop being impressed how well everything is organized: all possible
questions I might have are in weekly newsletters, mentors' online resources, or in group
announcements. And if (if!) I can't find an answer to my question I can always post it on our
forums and will get help right away – literally, within 10-15 min. Amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been mentoring three research teams so far and I am serving as a liaison for a teacher and her
three student teams. Interactions with students are incredibly rewarding, and I feel very lucky to

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;”..We document 289 living Japanese coastal marine species from
16 phyla transported over 6 years on objects that traveled thousands of kilometers across the
Pacific Ocean&lt;!--more--&gt; to the shores of North America and Hawai‘i. Most of this dispersal occurred on
nonbiodegradable objects, resulting in the longest documented transoceanic survival and dispersal of
coastal species by rafting…”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more I study invasive species the more I realize how little I (we?) know about them: they can
adapt to a new habitat relatively easily, they successfully compete with native species, they
disperse fast, and apparently long distance is also not an obstacle for them!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Carlton et al.

which is part of my Planting Science fellowship I received earlier this year. &lt;!--more--&gt; It was
wonderful experience: I enjoyed meeting biology teachers and other scientist mentors, and I’ve
learned a lot.  If you would have asked me “Where does the tree mass come from?” a week ago I would
have hard time explaining this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have a wonderful trip to the Garden of the Gods: red rocks are just gorgeous. Every time I
go to Colorado I discover something new. We also went to a “plant walk”, which was a 40 min-walk
from the BSCS building to our hotel accompanied by identification of plants we saw and amazing
stories about them – many thanks to our ‘tour guide’, Catrina!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to start working with teachers and their student teams this Fall!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to my students who did a great job choosing a plant species (in the first place!) for
which a partial sequence for the GAPDH gene (GAPC-2, 1139 bp) previously hasn’t been described, and
who, of course, worked hard on isolating and cloning this part of the gene.&lt;/p&gt;
