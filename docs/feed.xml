preparation to obtaining plant DNA sequences” has just been accepted for publication in Applications
in Plant Sciences!&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will come out in February 2014. This paper describes a protocol for isolating plant food DNA from
insect guts, developed specifically for grasshoppers. It is a very convenient and relatively quick
PCR-based method which allows accurate confirmation of food consumption by insect herbivores. Given
that grasshoppers are important agricultural pests and dominate insect herbivores in the grasslands,
knowledge of their feeding preferences is critical for both crop management and landscape
restoration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper includes this video which I made to illustrate the main steps of dissecting a grasshopper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently applying this protocol to exploring grasshoppers’ feeding choices with regard to
native and exotic plant species, which is another application of this method – to help managers to
effectively control invasive plants and/or predict invasion.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">My paper “Plant DNA detection from grasshopper gut contents: a step-by-step protocol, from tissues preparation to obtaining plant DNA sequences” has just been accepted for publication in Applications in Plant Sciences!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">First place at ESA meeting in Austin, TX</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2013/11/first-place-at-esa/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First place at ESA meeting in Austin, TX" /><published>2013-11-28T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2013-11-28T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2013/11/first-place-at-esa</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2013/11/first-place-at-esa/">&lt;p&gt;Last week I presented my research project on molecular confirmation of insect diet at the Annual

The main problem I
had to solve was building the cages.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cages had to be high enough to accommodate the plants. They also had to be low enough so that I
wouldn’t lose my grasshoppers there. I also needed some sort of a separator to divide the cage into
two halves – for control plants and plants with grasshoppers. From literature, I knew that the cage
should be metal, so that grasshoppers won’t chew through it and escape. Also, there should be screen
walls – to let enough light into the cage (both for plants and grasshoppers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some searching I ended up using open air aluminum screen cages (16×16×20″ Repti Breeze
Aluminum Screen Cage, Zoo Med Laboratories, Inc., California, USA). These cages are meant for
keeping reptiles, but their material, size, and shape were exactly what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I removed the bottom of the cage (it is just a plastic plate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;col-12 col-sm&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;figure mb-0&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img class=&quot;figure-img img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;/assets/content/blog/cage1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption text-left&quot;&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;col-12 col-sm&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img class=&quot;figure-img img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;/assets/content/blog/cage2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption text-left&quot;&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a separator I used a small regular window screen – you can find those in Lowe’s or Home Depot,
they are cheap. You can assemble your own, but I found one that was the perfect size for my cages.
On both sides of the separator I attached a thick window sealant strip – so that it fit tightly
against the screen walls of the cage and did not leave any holes for grasshoppers to move across the
cage and feed on control plants – and ruin my data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/content/blog/cage3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid mx-auto d-block&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I placed some extra soil inside the cages to cover all possible holes at the bottom. It is a good
idea to add even more soil than is needed: if it rains part of the soil will get washed out,
uncovering new holes. I also added more soil outside along the edges of the cages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/content/blog/cage4.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid mx-auto d-block&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my experiments by placing two different grass species in each half of the cage, but this
year I will be planting four different grasses – I expect them to fit (UPDATE: they did fit
perfectly!) I would not go with more than four though…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/content/blog/cage5.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid mx-auto d-block&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are field experiments – so fixing cages to the ground is another problem. I used two ropes and
four metal hooks; this proved to be very stable, even during heavy rain and strong wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/content/blog/cage6.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid mx-auto d-block&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cages turned out to be very convenient not only for field experiments but also for a temporarily
keeping grasshoppers in the lab (I usually keep them in the greenhouse). The cages have two doors,
and the lowest one is designed specifically for cleaning the cage without disturbing the reptiles –
that works for grasshoppers, too! I also often use this door for placing new grasshoppers in the
cage; they tend to jump up when released in the cage from a collecting bag and this way they will
not escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this might be useful to someone who conducts similar experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

on the board&lt;/a&gt; so much, that soon I started to add “Next lab assignment” rubric as well. As I
usually need all space on the board during the lab, &lt;!--more--&gt; I’ve decided to write a homework
assignment for the next lab in the right top corner of the board. I never need that space, whereas
my students always know where to find the assignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/content/blog/board2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;border-0 img-fluid mx-auto d-block&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started writing the assignment soon after a few students asked me several times about the
homework. It was an unexpected question for me; usually all assignments are posted on the course
webpage and are listed in the student’s lab manual along with all deadlines. I thought maybe it
would be helpful if I would remind them every time what they should focus on for their homework:
things such as, for example, reading chapter 3, pre-lab for week 2, bring your computers/textbooks
etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I’ve found this to be helpful for students: they can ask more specific questions about the
homework before they actually start doing it at home. Also, I’ve noticed that a few students from
time to time started doing their homework in class. It was the students who finished the lab earlier
than the rest of the class and didn’t want to waste the remaining time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It made me think that they considered the “next lab” note as a continuation of the lab flow that I
write on the board. On one hand, it is a good connection between the homework and material covered
in class: the students can start doing the homework while they still remember the lab and have an
opportunity to discuss it with their classmates and me. On the other hand, I am a little bit
concerned about the quality of their work when they are working so fast. I am still thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for my teaching side, writing the homework assignment helped me emphasize things in the lab flow
which students should focus on during the lab and which will help them later in their homework. This
approach definitely decreased the amount of questions about the type of the assignments; instead we
focus more on specific questions related to the homework’s content. In fact I have almost stopped
worrying about how well my students understand their homework assignments, not to mention the
decreasing of amount of emails with general questions. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I started thinking about what else I could put on the board to help me in class. Since I used
a projector very often for different information, I couldn’t have any notes displayed on the screen
for the duration of the lab. Also, I was worried that additional notes on the board might be
  unnecessary. So I started watching my explanations during the lab and marked (in my mind) the
  typical moments when I actually need to use the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the most often I referred to the board when I needed a scheme explaining the
order of steps of an experiment: liquid from what tube goes to what tube, what we add to the tube,
etc. Another typical situation when I needed the board were group projects: dividing
responsibilities between groups and group members. Since then each time I am dealing with a complex
experiment or group work I use the remaining space to write what I think is important for the
current lab. I’ve found that besides saving time and organizing the work, these notes also provide
visual cues for students for understanding the guidelines in the lab manual, as well as seeing their
own impact in any team project.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I liked the idea of writing a lab flow on the board so much, that soon I started to add “Next lab assignment” rubric as well.

Our typical lab usually includes a short lecture, a discussion about homework
(so called pre-labs), a wet lab (i.e., an experiment), and exercises or answering questions.
&lt;!--more--&gt;Having so many activities I found myself trapped in the situation where I have to explain
the next lab phase to students while some of them are still working and are not listening to me.
Even those who had finished the previous lab phase were not paying attention to me because of the
noise from the others. I didn’t feel comfortable at all: I was rather helpless and quite
unimportant. Besides, my teaching is also complicated by my accent: I am afraid that even if my
students hear me, they won’t be able to figure out what I’m trying to explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such situations were not very comfortable in my past either – even when I taught in my native
language. One simple solution for professors in my native country was to speak louder – eventually
all students would start looking at her and listening to the lecture. We were used to it as
students, we did it later as professors. There were, of course, different versions of this approach:
to speak very loud, to pause the lecture, or, as yet another option, I remember one professor used
to start whispering when students continued to talk. I tried some of these approaches, but I didn’t
like any of them. I thought all of them were artificial ways to attract students’ attention to what
the professor had to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I started thinking that such situations simply will not occur if the professor
naturally attracts students’ attention by doing and/or telling something interesting, as well as by
keeping students (and herself!) busy and organized during the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping this in mind I looked for ways to prevent these uncomfortable situations from happening, as
well as ways to reduce the possibility of students misunderstanding me due to my accent. One day I
followed the suggestion of one of my professors about a particularly complicated lab: she suggested
writing the lab flow on the board. Which I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/content/blog/board1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;border-0 img-fluid mx-auto d-block&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told my students that when they had finished one part of the lab they could look at the board for
what to do next. If I needed to give an explanation before each task, I waited until everyone
started doing the task, I would then ask them to pause and listen to my brief explanation, and then
they would continue. I’ve noticed that it helped me and students to be more organized; as a result,
I had less pauses in class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing the lab flow on the board for that complicated lab was helpful. In fact, it proved helpful
for any lab. Since then I have been writing flows for each lab, even the simple ones with few
activities. I have also realized that it is important to make my writing as clear and legible as
possible and to refer to the lab flow on the board often; otherwise, students simply wouldn’t pay
attention to what I wrote. The last bullet in the lab flow is especially important: it means the end
of the class – at which point students know what they should turn in before they go, what needs to
be cleaned up, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on feedback from students, this lab flow idea is helpful for them as well. Thinking back to my
past teaching experiences, I wish I knew this at that time. I am sure this simple approach would’ve
helped me keep students’ attention and make their learning experience more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I teach biology labs.

It was a very difficult moment for me
when I had just started teaching in the US. Mostly because there is no such thing as students
evaluations in my native country.&lt;!--more--&gt; It was one of many new things for me. I felt awful when
I first saw “she struggled with explaining concepts”, or “she was quiet and I couldn’t hear her”, or
“she graded hard”, or even better “she didn’t answer the questions and couldn’t conduct
discussions”…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that it is not only me who feels uncomfortable reading a bad review from students. A
professor I knew joked that she usually drinks a bottle of wine before sitting down to read her
evaluations. Someone else told me that students always complain about professors and he didn’t want
to know what they wrote about him. At a conference, I heard that some TAs simply stopped reading
evaluations, while others never even opened them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand such feelings. I also have things I am afraid of. I am afraid that students will not
understand my accent; I am afraid I’ll have to ask them to repeat the question several times until I
get it. Terrible feeling. I am afraid that I indeed will not know the answer and students will infer
that I might not know other things as well. However, one of the things I am not afraid of is to open
and to read student evaluations. I am even looking forward to them. Here is why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, people don’t want to read bad things in the reviews, but they forget that there are also good
things there. There is always a question “what do you like in your professor/TA?” in any evaluation;
and there are always some good things in the answer. Anyone, I think, would like to read something
good about themselves. I know I would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, reading evaluations is part of my job. It just needs to be done. Like grading, for example.
It is my responsibility as a TA (and as a future professor) to read student evaluations and to use
this information to improve my teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, finally, I think it is again a question of respect for my students and their time. My students
spent time answering the questions in the survey and writing their reviews. I have to appreciate
that.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">At the end of each semester I receive students evaluations.

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;she is very straightforward&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t sure what that meant. &lt;!--more--&gt;At first I thought it was just a language thing: I didn’t
have a large vocabulary during my first year of doctoral study, so teaching was often difficult.
Sometimes I wasn’t sure how to explain a concept, sometimes I didn’t know how to ask a question, or
make a comment, or ask students to do this or that – using the right, appropriate words. These
things seem simple enough, but for me they were not simple, especially during my first semester of
teaching in a new country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very straightforward. Was I not polite enough? I certainly didn’t mean to. In my next semester I
tried to use words like &lt;span class=&quot;ic4f-highlight&quot;&gt;“could you please”&lt;/span&gt;, or &lt;span class=&quot;ic4f-highlight&quot;&gt;“would you like”&lt;/span&gt; more often. However, another problem came about: now
every time before asking students to do something I had to think about how to ask them. Since I was
still working on improving my English (and still working!), that took some serious effort! But it
seemed like I was solving the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today it is easier for me to talk to my students. I am much more comfortable answering their
questions, helping them when they are wrong and encouraging them when they are right. I know I try.
However, when it comes to giving them specific feedback on grading, my hard times return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought about this over and over, trying to understand the roots of the problem. I think it cannot
be just language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s a culture thing? After all, I’m from another country. I recalled the time when I was a
professor in my native country and realized that I never worried about how to communicate with my
students. And here’s why: the important thing was the amount of knowledge the professor had. The
amount of knowledge meant authority; how to share that knowledge with the students was secondary.
And overall, the teaching process was more strict: students didn’t have much freedom; they didn’t
change advisors, committees, research topics, or their majors very easily – if at all. That must
have reflected on the way professors talked to students and how students talked – or, better,
listened – to their professors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think there’s something else – not just using the right words. After all, memorizing the words
I should (or shouldn’t) use with students didn’t really help much. So here’s my “big idea”: I think
the words reflect how I see myself, my status – comparing to how I see the status of my students,
and what I think of them. Do I think that I know everything on a given topic much better than they
will ever know; and does this give me a special right to talk to them from this position of
superiority? Or do I think of them as future colleagues who just happen to be studying what I had
studied earlier, and maybe later some of them will know this subject deeper than I do – after it
becomes their research area? Essentially, it is a question of respect: the more I respect my
students – the easier it is for me to talk to them. Even when I need to provide detailed feedback on
harsh grading. Because I think that, for them, obtaining such feedback is very much like, for me,
obtaining feedback from my professors on my own research: they always want me to change this or
that, but I also know they want to help me and they want me to succeed. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thus, the problem of finding the right words slowly went away. But I still need to work on my
vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In my very first evaluation that I received from my students here in the US I saw this comment: she is very straightforward. I wasn’t sure what that meant.</summary></entry></feed>
