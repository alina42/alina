This is a semester-long course; I see it as an upper-division undergraduate course but I think it can be easily adapted for a low-division undergraduate course or an elective graduate course. &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Invasion ecology is a fascinating area to me: Why do some introduced species become invasive? Why do some introduced species fail to establish? What can we do to learn more about invasive species?, etc. All these questions have been driving my research since my doctoral studies at the University of Cincinnati. This course has been my ‘pet’ project since then, and I developed it based on both my own research and teaching experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve designed this course to include weekly lectures and laboratories, weekly homework, online quizzes, as well as a mid-term and cumulative final exam. During both lectures and laboratories students would design and conduct experiments, develop and present group projects, participate in short local field trips, write article critiques, analyze case studies, and develop risk assessment protocols. I’d like my future students to gain all this experience and see themselves as scientists in training during that semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course outline with examples of lecture slides, assignments and worksheets are available &lt;a href=&quot;http://alinaavanesyan.com/courses/invasion-ecology&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
I’m currently exploring online alternatives for experimental laboratories and field trips. I really enjoyed developing this course, and I know I’ll enjoy even more teaching it some day!&lt;/p&gt;

This paper summarizes the results of my work on molecular confirmation of diet of the spotted lanternfly. In this study we showed, for the first time, that host plant DNA can be identified within the gut contents of the spotted lanternfly and demonstrated the use of this approach for deciphering the host plant range of the lanternfly. I’m very happy to get it done and be able to share.

&lt;p&gt;For this one-year study, we have proposed using a next-generation sequencing technology (‘Amplicon-EZ’) for meta-barcoding plant species from the gut contents of the invasive spotted lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula. Our current findings of plant DNA detection from the gut contents of the lanternfly nymphs using Sanger sequencing (Avanesyan and Lamp, manuscript is in preparation) suggest that while the observed lanternfly nymphs actively move on a host plant they may not utilize it for feeding. A substantial number of the nymphs (~90%) we have analyzed showed the ingested DNA from a host plant other than the plant from which the nymphs were collected. However, Sanger sequncing allowed us to detect and identify only DNA from one unique ingested plant. Conducting meta-barcoding of the lanternfly gut contents will allow us to detect multiple plant DNA fragments and detangle all possible associations with the host plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, we have successfully sequenced the gut content from one lanternfly nymph which yielded 139 ingested plant sequences. Among these fragments 12% were readable (i.e. long enough to use the BLAST engine in GenBank and identify the species), and among the readable ones - 12% were from the Bartramiaceae family, and 88% were from the Lamiaceae family. A substantial number of these plants are non-woody species which is very interesting (and important!) as the spotted lanternfly is considered to be a predominant tree pest.

&lt;p&gt;It has been challenging and very interesting work. In this study, we focused on assessing changes in morphology of (a) the lanternfly mouthparts (stylets and labium), and (b) the lanternfly tarsal tips (arolia and tarsal claws) at each developmental stage. Our study revealed several interesting developmental patterns which potentially allow L. delicatula to better attach to a host plant and deeper penetrate to the host plant tissues at the late nymphal stages and adult stage. Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The labium in adults consists of five segments whereas the nymphs have four labial segments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The labium and stylet length, as well as the tarsal claw dispersal from the arolium, exponentially increase by 4th- instar nymph and adult stage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mandibular stylets possess four indentations on the outer surface of the stylet apical part which become more evident in 4th-instar nymphs and adult&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Longitudinal striations between indentations are present on mandibular stylets of 4th-instar nymphs and adults&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arolia surface becomes wrinkled in late instars and adults&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changes in the angle of arolium growth follow the quadratic growth curve; the angle becomes obtuse in adults which potentially causes increase of the arolia basal width&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Additionally, we have found six morphological types of sensilla which are present at the labial tip at each developmental stage of L. delicatula; which potentially indicates the lanternfly ability to effectively explore the host plant suitability at each developmental stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first study on variation in the lanternfly external morphology across various developmental stages, and our findings are critical for investigating and predicting the lanternfly host range, and the lanternfly dispersal to new host trees at each developmental stage.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">One year of work, four months in review, two months in revision, and here you go - a wonderful Christmas present from PLOS ONE!

&lt;p&gt;His work was the essential part of our paper on the use of molecular markers for plant DNA detection from leafhopper gut contents (the manuscript is currently submitted).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bryan was also featured in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/johncarrollschool/photos/a.549607655156223/2147147948735511/?type=3&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;The John Carroll School News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m co-editing this special issue with Dr. Bill Lamp. Our proposal for this special issue has been approved, and the special issue has just been announced  &lt;!--more--&gt; on the journal’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Special Issue welcomes recent research on plant and animal DNA detection in the gut contents of insect herbivores and predators, respectively, as well as insect DNA detection in the gut contents of their predators, vertebrate or invertebrate. DNA-based protocols, short experimental reports, and original research articles, as well as review papers that broadly cover issues relating to molecular gut content analysis of various insect species (leaf-chewing insects, sap-feeders, soil-dwelling insects, etc.) and insect predators (both invertebrates and vertebrates) are of interest for this Special Issue. Studies that utilize both basic and advanced molecular biology methods are invited for submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deadline for the submission is March 15, 2020. I’m planning to contribute to this special issue with some results of my DNA barcoding work, and I’m looking forward to receiving new submissions!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’m serving as a Guest Editor for journal Insects, Special Issue “Molecular Gut Content Analysis: Deciphering Trophic Interactions of Insects”.

I presented ‘the morphological part’ of my lanternfly research – &lt;!--more--&gt;the adaptations of the lanternfly mouthparts and tarsal tips to their host plant usage. I enjoyed both the symposium and the opportunity to present my research. This is the 2nd postdoctoral symposium at the University of Maryland, and I really liked its workshops and the opportunity to meet and talk to other postdoctoral researchers across the university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/content/publications/2019_EBESA_poster.pdf&quot;&gt;poster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
