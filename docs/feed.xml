I love it! At first, I’ve decided to draw my favorite study species only, but it is hard to resist drawing anything beautiful I see. So my collection extended to some other insect species and plants. Last January, I took an online course “Drawing Nature, Science and Culture: Natural History Illustration 101”, a course of study offered by NewcastleX, an online learning initiative of The University of Newcastle. I proudly completed all the assignments (some of them are below) and earned a &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/content/misc/certificate.pdf&quot;&gt;certificate&lt;/a&gt;. The drawing of the eastern gray squarel was my final exam drawing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deviantart.com/totodor&quot;&gt;my page&lt;/a&gt; at deviantart.com where I post my new drawings as I finish them. This and last week two of my drawings, the spotted lanternfly and the silver maple, were featured at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deviantart.com/thepencilclub&quot;&gt;ThePencilClub&lt;/a&gt; - group. So exciting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our systematic review, we were specifically focused on the following questions:
(1) What insect groups were used for detecting ingested plant species using a PCR-based approach?
(2) Which DNA extraction methods have been used for detecting plant DNA from insect guts? 
(3) Which DNA regions have been shown to allow for successful identification of plant species? 
(4) How is the presence of the targeted plant DNA fragment verified?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our results showed that among five insect orders used in the retrieved studies Coleoptera and Hemiptera were prevalent (33 and 28% of all the records, respectively). In 79% of the studies a DNA barcoding approach was employed. In a substantial number of studies Qiagen DNA extraction kits and CTAB protocol were used (43 and 23%, respectively). Of all records, 65% used a single locus as a targeted plant DNA fragment; trnL, rbcL, and ITS regions were the most frequently used loci. Sequencing was the dominant type of among DNA verification approaches (70% of all records). This review provides important information on the availability of successfully used PCR-based approaches to identify ingested plant DNA in insect guts, and suggests potential directions for future studies on plant–insect trophic interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, using a combination of behavioral trials with A. reduvii on the BMSB egg masses, we recorded and analyzed 13 various types of behavior A. reduvii performed. Our results demonstrated that (a) A. reduvii performed up to four new types of behavior in the presence of other parasitoids; (b) A. reduvii spent significantly less time off the egg mass and more time walking in the presence of another A. reduvii and T. japonicus; (c) A. reduvii spent more time probing/ovipositing on the egg mass in the presence of another A. reduvii than that in the presence of T. japonicus, and (d) in the presence of another A. reduvii, both host-feeding and probing/ovipositing showed significant association with eggs outcome, resulting in ~50% reduction of BMSB hatchlings. We believe that our findings would allow us to better understand interspecific and intraspecific interactions of A. reduvii and, their effect on the BMSB egg fate, which is valuable for developing effective biological control of BMSB.&lt;/p&gt;

I can only imagine the amount of work which had been done to make it happen in this difficult and stressful time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I presented one of my research projects on novel plant-insect interactions. In this project, we explored variation in plant responses to grasshopper herbivory among the cultivars of the introduced Miscanthus sinensis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a video recording of my talk, and here are my &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/content/publications/2020_Botany_talk.pdf&quot;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a semester-long course; I see it as an upper-division undergraduate course but I think it can be easily adapted for a low-division undergraduate course or an elective graduate course. &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Invasion ecology is a fascinating area to me: Why do some introduced species become invasive? Why do some introduced species fail to establish? What can we do to learn more about invasive species?, etc. All these questions have been driving my research since my doctoral studies at the University of Cincinnati. This course has been my ‘pet’ project since then, and I developed it based on both my own research and teaching experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve designed this course to include weekly lectures and laboratories, weekly homework, online quizzes, as well as a mid-term and cumulative final exam. During both lectures and laboratories students would design and conduct experiments, develop and present group projects, participate in short local field trips, write article critiques, analyze case studies, and develop risk assessment protocols. I’d like my future students to gain all this experience and see themselves as scientists in training during that semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course outline with examples of lecture slides, assignments and worksheets are available &lt;a href=&quot;http://alinaavanesyan.com/courses/invasion-ecology&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
I’m currently exploring online alternatives for experimental laboratories and field trips. I really enjoyed developing this course, and I know I’ll enjoy even more teaching it some day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Invasive spotted lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula, my current primary research object. We know so little about this unusual and one of the most aggressive forest insect pests in the eastern US.
