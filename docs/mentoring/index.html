<p>In my postdoctoral work in <a href="http://www.clfs.umd.edu/entm/lamp/index.html">Dr. Bill Lamp’s lab</a> at the University of Maryland I proposed, developed and managed DNA barcoding flow for our lab research: I set up DNA extraction, PCR, and electrophoresis protocols, proposed and acquired reagents and equipment, set up sequencing software, managed sequencing service, trained and coordinated lab members. This DNA barcoding work became the main part of several ongoing projects in Dr. Bill Lamp’s lab, such as: wetland-stream connectivity; dragonflies diet composition; and host plant usage of potato leafhoppers and the spotted lanternfly.</p>

<p>Over the past 2 years, I mentored 11 students in various DNA barcoding research projects. I trained the students in tissue preparation, DNA isolation, PCR, visualization results using gel electrophoresis, sequence analysis and depositing the sequences to the NCBI GenBank datase, as well as retrieving data from published studies as part of our planned systematic review on molecular approaches to study insect diet. All this work resulted in 10 student GenBank submissions and 2 student school symposium presentations (with 1 award). I also have two manuscripts in preparation with two of my mentees as coauthors. I enjoy working with my students and seeing their progress, and I’m very happy for their big and small successes.</p>

<hr />

<p>I mentored two graduate students and several undergraduate students in their research projects which involved insect diet analysis using various molecular biology techniques. The students worked on plant DNA detection from the potato leafhopper and the spotted lanternfly guts: we tried to identify insect host plants, confirm their ingestion, and explore insect host plant switch during insect development. The students isolated plant DNA sequences, conducted sequence analysis, and learn how annotate the sequence and deposit it to GenBank.</p>

<h3><strong>1. Molecular gut content analysis of the potato leafhopper</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Bryan</strong>, a high school student, was working with us during last Spring semester, and I was really impressed by his incredible progress during those several months. Bryan joined us in January knowing nothing about wet lab techinques for DNA barcoding process; he worked once a week only learning all the steps; and by the end of April he had successfully extracted genomic DNA from 100+ leafhopper samples, amplified plant DNA from leafhopper guts and succesfully obtained and deposited four plant sequences. His work was the essential part of our paper on the use of molecular markers for plant DNA detection from leafhopper gut contents (the manuscript is currently in preparation).</p>

  <li>09/23/19: I was very pleased to learn recently that Bryan was admitted to the University of Maryland where he continues studying Molecular Biology. Bryan was also featured in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/johncarrollschool/photos/a.549607655156223/2147147948735511/?type=3&amp;theater">The John Carroll School News</a>. I’m so happy for him!</li>

<h3><strong>2. Molecular gut content analysis of the spotted lanternfly</strong></h3>
<p>Over the past 2 years, I mentored several students in different aspects of the molecular gut content analysis of the spotted lanternfly. <strong>Jessica</strong> and <strong>Nurani</strong>, our former lab managers, conducted DNA extractions and PCR amplification of a portion of trnL-intron from ingested plants; <strong>Darsy</strong>, a Ph.D. student, helped with obtaining and depositing plant sequences to the NCBI GenBank database; <strong>Hannah</strong>, an undergraduate student, is currently working on meta-barcoding of the lanternfly gut contents using a NGS-approach.</p>

<p><strong>Hannah</strong>, my former mentee and a great helper, made an incredible progress: after less than a month of training she independently conducted all the steps from DNA isolation, PCR, and preparing samples for NGS sequncing. Hannah is currently working on identification of obtained sequences, as well as a qualitative analysis of the spectrum of ingested host plants. She is also actively participating in another project, a systematic review of molecular approaches to decipher insect herbivore diet (manuscript is in preparation with Hannah as a coauthor).</p>

<p>‘Wetland-stream connectivity’ connectivity is yet another exciting project; my mentee, <strong>Nina</strong>, a high school student, was working on this project more than year. During her work she created a reference library of mitochondrial sequences from stream isopod species - she then ‘BLASTed’ sequences from wetland isopod individuals against this library to determine the matches and estimate how ‘close’ wetland species were to stream species.</p>

<h2 id="microscopy">Microscopy</h2>
<p>During my postdoctoral work at the University of Wisconsin-Madison I trained a high school student in tissue dissection and isolation, slide preparation, tissue and cell identification, morphological analysis. Claire did a research project on the spotted wing drosophila through the Biotechnology Youth Apprenticeship program. Claire learned how to use a new protocol I developed for dissecting fly tissues and determining fly mating status. She successfully applied this new technique to different fly specimens; she also created beautiful illustrations for an invited manuscript which we published later in Insects. Here are some of the figures Claire made for our <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28287438">paper</a>:</p>

<h2 id="plantingscience-mentor">PlantingScience Mentor</h2>

<p>As a <a href="https://plantingscience.org/members/5520/profile">PlantingScience fellow</a>, during summer/fall 2017 I participated in the <a href="https://plantingscience.org/">PlantingScience program</a> (Botanical Society of America; Digging Deeper project). I was an online scientist mentor and liaison for student research teams (high school and middle school students).</p>

<p>That was my first year with the PlantingScience program. I really enjoyed our summer workshop in Colorado Springs and meeting with biology teachers from around the country, as well as our wonderful trip to the Garden of the Gods. Last Fall, I was a scientist mentor for nine research teams and a liaison for a biology teacher and three research teams in her class. The student teams which I mentored, focused on <a href="https://plantingscience.org/posinformation">The Power of Sunlight</a> module and conducted their independent research projects on plant photosynthesis and respiration.</p>

<p>Since then, I stayed with PlantingSceince, and I’ve been serving as a scientist mentor every semester. During Fall 2018, I worked as a member of Master Plant Science Team serving  as a liaison for one class and a mentor for three student teams. Great experience! I’m continously looking forward to being a part of this interesting program every semester!</p>
